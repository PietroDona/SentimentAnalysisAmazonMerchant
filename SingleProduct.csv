They contacted me right away after I posted this review asking if they could send me a new port.  I agreed and in my next email told them I was no longer at that address; I travel for business.  They had already mailed out the product before seeing my email and  re-sent another port to the current address.  Their amazing customer service NEVER wavered even though my travels took me elseware which delayed a re-review of their product.  The new port works flawlessly and doesn't disrupt the power when I have 4 - 3.0 harddrives all plugged in an operating!

There are in fact 2 models that look identical",2016-04-07,True,"I like this hub, and I like Anker products.  However, I need to deduct 1 star because of variances in the models that are not listed (as far as I can see), or apparent from their pictures.The model of hub that comes with a power adapter for 2x the cost of the non-power adapter-included model and is NOT the same as the power-included model. The non-power adapter models LACKS the additional power hole so that you can power the hub (to run devices like USB hard drives, scanners, etc.).  Again, no pictures show this omission, nor did I see it in writing anywhere.It is a shame because this is a great hub and the company seems to make quality items, they just fail to mention that the item comes sans an ability to add power; note that the ability to power your hub is not needed for many USB devices.  Don't get me wrong, the hub works fine without the power adapter, it is not needed on 90% of the USB items I use.  But some items need power, and one of their models does not have the option to add supplemental power if needed.It is also a shame because Anker also did another AMAZING thing on the powered model.  Rather than using a barrel connector to power their hub (which will get lost at some point by anyone), Anker went with a MICRO-USB connector to add supplemental power to their hub.  What this means is that if you lost the power cable, any Samsung/Android cell phone charger you have will work to power this hub.  That is a STELLAR idea, and I wish more manufacturers would get away from semi-proprietary power connections and stick with industry-standard USB cables for powering low-voltage devices, such as this USB hub.",184.0

When I selected the first ""Generic Port"" it listed the items plugged into the hub: the wireless mouse receiver at 100 mA and the same for the keyboard receiver. I have a video card plugged into another port by itself, it shows 500 mA.

I purchased 2 of these for different computers (Apple Mac Minis) and both caused interference in the same way on both computers.

I am an Amazon PRIME customer and expect that Amazon will make this item (offered through PRIME) right-- we'll see, but exactly because these were offered as a PRIME product, I was persuaded to buy it thinking that the PRIME label would provide buyer protection. It was not until later that I saw that ""This item isn't eligible for return.""  Note that in the Warranty section of the product listing on the Amazon.com site, there is no mention of this PRIME ""no return"" policy.  Can I trust PRIME to protect me?

Now this may be due to the fact that I am an Amazon PRIME member, and may be a good reason for PRIME membership.  As to the two Anker 4-port hubs, Amazon says that there is NO need to return them.  I can just toss them into the waste bin.  Thank you Amazon PRIME.UPDATE No. 2:  Anker has been most accommodating and has tried to make some restitution for this defective 4-port hub design, offering cables and chargers, but I don't need those, I need a working USB 3.0 hub.  So they sent me their ""4-Port USB 3.0 Ultra Slim Data Hub with 3.3ft USB 3.0 Extension Cable for Mac, PC, USB Flash Drives and Other Devices"".  I told them that I would evaluate it and hoped that moving the hub farther from the computer might solve the interference issue and that I would give a fair evaluation here.  Sadly, it is the same 4-port hub, just with a cable extension, and suffers from the same problems.  I tried it on two different computers and it still adversely affected bluetooth and Wifi.  Unplugging the hub instantly cures the problem.  Therefore my negative one-star review must stand as a warning to others regarding this product.  It needs to be heavily shielded and taken off the market until that redesign is accomplished.  Sorry Anker :(",135.0

(Windows) (two unexpected encounters though),2021-11-11,True,"I needed more usb ports and my MSI GP73 Leopard8RE gaming laptop only comes with 3, so headset takes 1, cooling fan pad takes 1, and mouse takes one, leaving no others for use. I bought this as it adds 4 more usb ports when needed. Since this laptop has the 3.2 gen 2 version of usb-c, I figured id use this one for my external drive and it works great. Note: I just use a generic external 1tb hdd, nothing high end to use the full capabilities of the usb-c as using an ssd you would actually get the full ssd speeds should you choose too.. The 2 unexpected encounters:1. For some reason when using my surround headset (usb) in this hub along with my external drive (that was actually being used with the game I was playing, meaning both sound and game files coming through simultaneously), The sound would cut out, there was no stuttering of the game, but the sound would get all delayed as more ""action"" would come on screen. (decided to just plug headset into laptop directly using one of the ports as mentioned above.2. This could be phone related, though I suspect driver related to be the likely problem. I have a pixel 2xl and it is a usb-c phone (one of the first actually which may also be the limitation of the phone), I could not use this with this hub to xfer files or anything and its not a charging port. So when I need to xfer files, I just swap out the headset port with the phone.(further thoughts on phone issue: I am fully aware that windows and android butt heads a lot and they never got their act together after the 2010 court battle.  I generally dont plug my phone into a desktop or laptop anymore unless I forget my usb-c flash drive... I generally just plug the usb-c flash drive into my phone xfer files, then plug that into my desktop/laptop due to this failure of cooperation by Microsoft and Google.)-Other than those 2 things, I have not had a problem with multiple things plugged in like other flash drives simultaneously.",

I am using it to plug in my wireless mouse and wireless keyboard. The 2 USB plugs I have connect flawlessly with my laptop. However, when I try plugging in my USBs to the Anker hub I struggle to push in the USBs at all. It took me 10 minutes of wiggling to get my wireless mouse USB to plug into the hub. The hub just seems cheaply made. I've tried plugging in a couple other USBs and they are all difficult to plugin. Also, the USB plug on the Anker that goes into my laptop inserts easily, but it loosely plugged in. I have made sure its pushed in all the way and it just doesn't fit well. I would not recommend this product to others, and for $10 it is not worth the hassle.UPDATE (2/14/18): The seller sent me a new USB hub without me asking. This one actually performs better and is easier for me to connect my USB's. I'm much happier with the product and very happy with the customer service.

I decided to upgrade to a 4-port 3.0 device, and since I don't particularly like the push buttons on the ports, I decided to try Anker as I have several of their products.Apparently there is no pass through power as like in the Sabrent port adapter.  Not only is their little power, it would seem they have *blocked* the pass through power.  This device won't power up the drives at all, regardless of how many are connected.  I have no expectation of charging accessories, but I did have an expectation of the hub delivering at least as much power was available to it's connected port.I immediately swapped back out the adapter to the old one, and had *no* issues, just slower USB 2.0 transfer rate, and yes, the Sabrent also lists the same disclaimer about power hungry drives, but at least delivers the main port power to the hub. There is an expectation a hub should at least distribute what power is available from the main USB port into which it's plugged.  This does not.I recognize there is a 'disclaimer' about powered drives in their descritption, but obviously they have constructed this device with less capability than the older Sabrent 2.0 counter part.  And of course, marked ""non-returnable"" in my order list.  I should have, and will now purchase the Sabrent 3.0 hub instead and toss this one out as I have no use for a 4-port hub that won't deliver anything other than a being a small 4 flash drive hub and pass no power from an iMac USB port.Something is missing these days in Anker products.

I don't know if this is due to broken wires inside the cable (which has no strain reliefs), or just a bad USB-A plug design. The stiffness of the host cable makes such disturbances inevitable when adding or removing devices from the hub, and it also makes placing the hub where you want it difficult.My other complaint - not nearly as big of an issue as the above - is that there's no option for providing external power. I understood at the time of purchase that it would not come with an external power supply, but I was led to believe by the product pictures that I could provide my own power supply if I wanted a self-powered option. However, since I knew up front that I was buying the bus-powered model, I can't complain too much about the lack of a self-powered option.Were it not for the stiff host cable and unreliable host connection, I'd give this hub at least a 4- or 5-star rating. It's a fully USB 3.0 compliant bus-powered hub, it's lightweight, small and portable. I typically connect this hub to the pass-through port on my keyboard, and use it primarily to connect flash drives and wireless transceivers for HID devices (Logitech wireless mouse and game controllers).",

My original review is below, describing the problems I had.)BUT, that said, I absolutely *love* Anker, and they stand behind their products. They saw my negative review here, and reached out to ask if they could replace the product or give me a refund. Since I figured that the RF issue was a design problem, I said I'd prefer a refund, which they did, and quickly.While I had a bad experience with this product, I'm still an Anker fan (even more than before), and will continue to buy their products over those offered by others. This was my only remotely negative experience with an Anker product, and they reached out to me without prompting.So... I've increased the rating to 2 stars from one, as I hope my review will save someone from having the same trouble I did - but Anker deserves a lot of credit for their excellent customer service!-----I usually love Anker products, and own a lot of them. This little hub cost me a day's worth of WiFi connection and hours of troubleshooting on a recent trip.The short story: This thing apparently puts out RF interference, so when it's plugged into a MacBook Pro USB-C port, it'll jam the WiFi signal. I was tearing my hair over the hotel WiFi until I finally lugged my laptop down to the front desk to show them the problem. Lo and behold, it worked perfectly, was actually very high-speed. Went back to my room, it was working and very fast there as well. Huh, mystery of the universe. I got to work, plugged all my stuff back into the laptop, and the WiFi was dead again. An hour or so of plugging and unplugging things one at a time, rebooting, etc, showed me that this hub was the culprit. It was particularly bad if it had anything plugged into it that was drawing much current, especially a portable hard drive I had. (It turns out that portable hard drives can cause similar problems with WiFi, but this hub compounded it.)So a word to the wise: If you're having problems with hotel WiFi, try unplugging everything from your laptop, and see if things improve. One symptom of a device causing problems is that you'll see a lot fewer networks identified in your WiFi login dialog with the device plugged in than not.

I admit to not paying enough attention to the product image or description.Simply speaking, I didn't believe the photo was right. I mean who on earth would make a USB hub with a 6"" cable? With so many product images being heavily Photoshopped, and images on Amazon not being of the actual item being sold, it is VERY hard to tell for sure what you are getting.For use with desktop computers, this thing is very difficult to useIn order to actually get the ports anywhere useful, you have to add a USB 3.0 a/b cable. Which is an added expense. Desktops typically have the USB 3.0 ports on the back of the system. And stuffed in a desk, meaning to plug / unplug anything from the hub, you need to drag your computer out from under your desk to make the connection. Just not my idea of fun.For my laptop use it's a different story.I can use my USB hard drive, as well as my USB KVM cable where the cable actually reaches. Sadly on my laptop, the video port is on the side with the sole USB 3.0 port.The manufacturer / vendor has contacted me in regards to the cable issue, and appears to be very receptive to product input from customers, for which I am very grateful. This will serve them well in their business for years to come!The short cable issue aside, this has been a great little USB 3.0 hub. Disk performance using this is fine. No real problems. I can transfer data from my phone, to my external hard drive. No lags even when editing video.The form factor is quite small, and compact, again a great feature for your laptop bag, and not too bad for desktop use.Materials seem to be pretty much industry standard plastics, PVC, and metal etc... Nothing too shabby, nothing too fancy. Certainly no bling to brag about but that isn't what a USB hub is for anyway.All in all, I think I am going to get a different hub for my desktop application, and stash this one in my laptop bag where it is an ideal fit.",

I will consider Anker products in the future because of their excellent service.My initial review:The hub Installed easily and it worked as expected for a week or two.  Began having ""driver power state failure"" errors and then my whole system would crash.  My PC is new,  refurbished, less than 4 months old and uses Windows 10 home.  Identifying the problem was time consuming.  Updated each and every USB driver one at a time via device manager (some of the USB drivers DID download as new - widows 10 update did not update these drivers automatically).  Problem did not go away.  Did meticulous analysis and worked with the pc vendor support. Eventually a USB port was identified by trial and error, using the error log and other methods.  The hub itself was not directly identified as the issue.  In fact got a authorization to return the pc for repair (they sent the box to return the PC).  Kept the hub out of the picture for a few days and tired to repeat the error.  I could not and have not returned the PC to the vendor.  This hub product was only used for a wireless mouse and a wireless keyboard.I am now using a powered hub without any problems.

(Note I received it today and tested immediately.  So, no ""aging"" data to report.)I've owned dozens of USB hubs over the years, and used them on both Windows and Mac.  I've learned (the hard way) to be highly skeptical of vendor claims about hubs.  For example, it's easy to slap ""USB 3.0"" on a product, even if the hardware is crappy.  When that's the case, you're getting lousy performance.  Remember: USB 3.0 is just an industry spec designed to offer speeds ""up to"" such and so.  It's not a promise that you're going to get that.  That part is up to the vendor.  So, don't get too excited just because you see ""USB 3.0"".The only question for a hub: will it perform as well as a direct connection to your machine?  My tests show the Anker does that.  (All tests on a Macbook Air 13"", and its USB 3.0 ports.)I used a great utility called BlackMagic Disk Speed Test (free at the app store).  This writes and reads test data to / from any drive you select and gives you a real number of what you're getting.  (And they do it properly, in Megabytes Per Second, denoted as MB/s.  Don't be fooled by products that use MegaBITS Per Second, denoted as ""mbps"".  There are 8 bits in a byte, so ""mbps"" inflates the figure by a factor of 8, which is deceptive.)So, here's the result.  First, I connected an external SSD drive directly to the Macbook Air USB port, and ran BlackMagic on it:Write speed: 231 MB/sRead speed: 250 MB/sThen I disconnected the SSD, plugged in the Anker hub, and then plugged the SSD into the hub.Result?

Combining both cost, function, and style, Anker has produced a basic hub, but really it is the most important hub you can buy.The Anker 4-port hub is networking peripheral that that turns one USB 3.0 port into four.  Built for the USB 3.0 standard, this hub accommodates the 5Gb/s transfer speeds that is becoming a standard to almost any USB peripheral.  For those that are complete oblivious, USB 3.0 is a further modification on the USB standard that while backwards compatible with older versions of USB, it is distinct piece of hardware.  In addition to using blue-colored plugs, USB 3.0 uses additional connectors in the plug accessible only with other USB 3.0 connectors – when this anker USB hub is connect to another USB 3.0 device, you can unlock the fastest transfer speeds USB 3.0 is capable of.Really, no matter what USB version connect with the anker hub, the max transfer speeds is what you can expect.  I have used with USB 2.0 flash drives and USB 3.0 external hard drives  and the transfer speeds were fast, with multi-gigabyte data transfers taking only minutes to complete when copied to a solid-state drive.  Admittedly, I bought the Anker USB hub primarily for its cost, its turned out to be an awesome addition to my computer and it will do the same for you.",1.0

This is exactly what I've been needing for a long time! I have only 2 USB 2.0 ports on my Dell laptop (running Windows 10) and both are used up by my external backup drive and headphone so when I needed to plug in anything else, like my iPhone or another drive, I'd have to unplug one or the other. This isn't really ideal and I've lived with the annoyance for too long. Now that I have this nifty gadget, it's made everything so much easier. I now have more USB ports than I can use - a rather nice problem to have! I was really surprised by how tiny it is when I received it, despite having seen pictures of it online but it's perfect. It feels very light but I wouldn't say flimsy. The cable is short but solid and sufficient for my needs. I've been using it for about a week now and I'm really happy with it. I just learned recently though that I should not expect USB 3.0 data transfer speed because I have the device connected to a root USB 2.0 port. However, it's working as designed so I'm OK with the speed. According to the manual, it does say so as well, namely, ""To transfer data at superfast speeds, your computer, peripherals, cables and software must all support USB3.0."" Also, there is a warning about how to ensure stable connections - Connected devices should not exceed a combined current of 900mA. So, if you're having issues with the device, maybe you've connected too many power hungry devices to the data hub. The manual said typically Mouse (100mA), Camera (300mA), Keyboard (500mA), and External Hard Drive (900mA). When I saw that, I unplugged my external hard drive from the data hub and plugged it in directly to my laptop. Future issues averted...hopefully. In any case, I'm very pleased with my purchase and with the small size and seemingly good quality of the product. I would definitely recommend it and would give it a 5.0/5.0! - 02/02/2017",1.0

At first glance it seems cheep with how little it weighs, but when put to the test, you will find that it can balance whatever four usb plug-ins you need.

The listing on Amazon simply is not extensive enough to make an informed decision about it.  Anker customer service however is quite good and they are well versed in all the technical specifics of their product line.

I like that the jacks are on one side so the plugs of the connected devices are supported by the same surface as the hub.

Note that this is a little hub, and there is only room for up to 5/8 inch per jack. That is plenty of room for a USB plug, but sometimes USB thumb drives are wider, in which case, there would not be room to have it next to another drive that needs 5/8 in.I connected it to a USB 3.0 jack on my Windows 7 computer then plugged 4 USB 2.0 thumb drives into the hub and was able to access all the drives with no problem. When I plugged only an externally powered USB 2.0 HD into the hub, my Logitec wireless mouse would not work when the bluetooth receiver was plugged into the adjacent USB 3.0 jack. However, the mouse worked fine when I swapped its receiver with a device in a USB 2.0 jack. This is the result of noise from USB 3.0 in the same frequency range as the wireless mouse receiver, so I moved the receiver to a USB 2.0 jack as far away from the USB 3.0 jack as possible.

This hub has a great form factor. It's very compact which helps with travel convenience. The cable is very short, yet feels strong and durable, and the hub itself is very, very light, almost to the point of feeling a little bit cheap.I had data transfer issues ONCE and it seemed to be due to a sudden loss of connectivity when I moved the hub slightly and it disconnected my drives, but I was not able to replicate this problem.My one gripe with this hub is that, for some reason, it severely affects the WiFi connectivity on my 2015 MacBook Pro. I had been having issues connecting to my home wifi network for over a week. It got to the point that I changed ISPs, did a clean install of Mac OS X Sierra and was even about to buy a new router, when I noticed, by sheer accident, that the connection was dropping ONLY when this hub was plugged in.Before I continue, I want to make it clear that I have worked my entire teenage and adult life with computers and I make a living working as IT Tech support, so computers and technology are my life and I absolutely know my way around them.Having that said, I started troubleshooting with this hub and another hub also made by Anker. I did a lot of tests while monitoring the connection to my router.I held a sustained ping to my router (192.168.1.1) to detect any changes in response time as I connected and disconnected my SSD, HDD and other USB cables. During all tests, the average response time was about 2.4 ms, but whenever I plugged in this hub, the response time would rise to an average of 600 ms with many timeouts. Leaving the hub plugged in for more than 5 minutes would cause the connection to drop entirely and make it impossible to reconnect. As soon as the hub is unplugged, the connection goes back to normal. This behavior was consistent regardless of any cables or devices plugged into the hub. Even the hub by itself, with absolutely nothing else attached, caused the connection to drop.One VERY IMPORTANT thing to mention is that this happens ONLY when I plug the hub to the left side USB port. It does not happen if I plug it on the right side USB port. The response time does increase but the average is almost the same (about 2.7 ms)So bottom line, I feel that I can recommend this hub, but do beware that it MIGHT cause wifi issues if you use it on a MacBook Pro.",1.0

Kind reminder on our listing, 2.4Ghz wireless devices (keyboards, mice, etc.) may not work around USB 3.0 ports. The USB 3.0 device may limit the sensitivity of any wireless receiver whose antenna is physically located close to the USB 3.0 device. This may result in a drop in the throughput on the wireless connection.So could you please plug your wireless mouse on the host port of your computer or use an USB 2.0 extension cord to move 2.4Ghz wireless devices away from USB 3.0 hub?Please keep us updated. Thanks for your time.========================================I really liked how small this hub is. It would be ultra-portable and not take up any space at all. However, it's clear that it doesn't work with my MacBook. Even if I went with their recommendation and used an extension cord for the wireless mouse, it would still kill the wifi connection. I refuse to MacGyver a system that worked perfectly fine before receiving this hub. I didn't test this on my Lenovo Yoga, but I would guess it would have the same issues as the MacBook. Hopefully my boyfriend can use this with his giant, custom built desktop computer. Otherwise, this ultra slim hub is going in the trash.",2.0

I bought another one for myself to use at school as a way to keep track of my bluetooth and Logitech receivers when I use the computer lab.I very much dislike using public keyboards because they are disgusting, so I bought a bluetooth keyboard for my comp sci class. I needed to get a USB bluetooth adapter in order to connect to the computer, and I also needed to carry around the Logitech receiver for my MX2 mouse. Because both were so small and difficult to remove once plugged in, I decided to get a small USB hub to plug them into. This way, I would only have to worry about plugging one thing in rather than several.I bought Anker's hub because, as I mentioned above, my dad has used one for years without a problem. I am also a big fan of Anker and own many of their products. I would use an Anker USB hub for my iMac at home, but I own a Satechi model that clamps to my desk, making it more useful for my at-home needs.For my portability needs, however, Anker's hub works wonderfully. The slim design allows it to be stored in my keyboard carry case, and the reinforcement on the cable leading from the hub means I don't have to worry about the cord being damaged. I have both my bluetooth and Logitech receiver plugged in at all times and plug my USB 3 drive into it whenever I'm in class. The read/write rates are fast and I can easily save documents to the flash drive as I work on them. All in all, having a hub to plug all my small receivers into gives me peace of mind.

So I had to buy a new keyboard/mouse set with the same USB sooo now I have two keyboards two mice and NO working USB hub.*Update* the company reached out to me they said the 2.4 GHz wireless devices, MIDI devices, and some USB 3.0 devices may not be supported on this USB 3.0 Hub. Currently, it is a general issue for USB 3.0 devices. It may help if you use an extension USB cable for this USB 3.0 hub or you can try a USB 2.0 hub if you have one. So if you do buy this product do be aware of that. While I will probably not use the hub I do appreciate the company reaching out to me to let me know what went wrong. I did take it up to work to try a keyboard with a cord and it did seem to work. So the hub is not broken it just wasn’t able to support both a wireless mouse and keyboard.",

If you only need a hub for your wireless mouse/keyboard receiver, or a printer, get a USB 2.0 hub instead.",

I blame the development team for not properly testing them.UPDATE: The Anker support team has stepped up and took responsibility for their product, they have send me a new model that has a wall charger option Finding a wall outlet is a little hard for me since I'm always on the go, but I found that using my laptop's 2nd usb port works just as well at providing the additional power.

Since it USB 3.0 you are also able to transfer at high speeds (supports upto 5GBPS). Currently this hub is mounted under my tabletop so it does not draw any attention.

As for the power drain reports of some reviews, USB devices drain power on their own, so the blame can't be attributed to the hub feeding off a laptop port. If you have an unusually high power draw USB device, plugging that directly to another laptop port (if available) may be an option if you experience an issue, but I personally had no trouble at all.

I think I ended up saving one USB port with these. I got this Hub for my USB-challenged desktop with the hope of filling the hub up and having some ports left over. Well.... not so much. The first inkling of trouble was when my USB WIFI adapter immediately started acting up. Up and down more often than an Olympic pole-vaulting team. As soon as I moved the WIFI adapter from this hub back to my PC, it started working perfectly again. The next problem was my scanner. The first time I scanned, the scan hung up halfway through the scan and I got a popup message about an error on my portable USB drive that was also connected to the hub. Not cool. This happened on the very next scan, so I pulled the scanner off this hub and moved it back to the PC. Problem solved again. By this time, I no longer trust the hub with any of my data, so I also moved my drive from the hub back to my PC.So... the only thing I trust this adapter with is my keyboard and mouse, both of which are non-critical if they error, so two ports on the hub sit empty, and I've saved exactly one USB port.Take your chances folks, but I'm not impressed even a little.UPDATE: SEP 10 2016Bumped review from 1 to 3 stars. Why? Because Anker actually believes in customer support. You can buy their products with the confidence that they will work with to to be sure you're satisfied.

However, that being said, it doesn't always work. I used an extender, since my computer is under the desk and I was looking for something to have accessible ports up where I actually use them. Sometimes it recognizes the things I plug in with no issues, and other times it just doesn't seem to recognize that I have anything plugged in at all. Sometimes moving it to a different slot works, and sometimes I finally end up crawling under the desk too plug something in, where it always works without any issues. I'm not sure why I get such inconsistent results with it, but especially given this is an Anker product, and I usually love their stuff, I am disappointed. I would not purchase this specific model again.EDIT 8/18/17Okay, so I realized after talking to the company that the issue wasn't with the hub, it was that I didn't read the description close enough to realize I needed the version that has an independent power source, rather than this one, which just takes its power from the computer. Anker customer support was AMAZING. Even after I realized it was totally my fault, they still sent me the powered hub I should have bought in the first place - without charging me extra or even asking that I send back the first one. This just cemented my impression that Anker is a seriously amazing company to do do business with. They went above and beyond what I would have expected from them in this situation.So don't be like me - if you need this hub so you can plug in external drives and things that require charging, do yourself a favor and get the powered one to begin with!

I used QC 2.0 fast charger, if plugged directly , my phone shows charging around  ~2000 mA. But if plugged to this hub it was doing below 200 mA. I think, charger does know if device on another side of the hub is compatible with QC 2 and hub is not smart enough to provide that information to the charger, as result only 1 A get sent to the hub, and hub splits it in four.

That laptop comes with little very few USB inputs. Having something like this is a headache saver.I originally gave it two stars because while all ports worked it came with a massive defect.  Every time I disconnected one device that's connected all other drives would unexpectedly get disconnected and then reconnect themselves.The people at Anker quickly sent me a replacement 4-port that seemed to work as advertised. Then a week later the problem actually got worse than the previous ""defective"" item they sent me.  Now, when my laptop goes to sleep all the hard drives connected through this 4-port get disconnected. Great way to damage your drives. At least on the original defective one, it only did that when i disconnected one of the drives.I would fully avoid this item unless you want to risk constant disconnection of your hard drives when you're away from your computer. That can lead to damaged data. I will probably repurpose this as some sort of power center for phone and ipad instead of it's intended use.I gave it two stars only because the people at Anker were kind of enough to send me a replacement item on their own dime which ended up being worse than the original one i purchased.Good customer service.

I forgot where I was going with this.  Oh! Right!  This thing is slower than my brain right now... which as you might be able to tell... could use some sleep more than writing reviews.

The second star is for the price being low enough that I felt it was a better use of my time to donate it to Goodwill than to try and get my money back.

Device lag. Used this on both a mac and pc and had similar results:-With a single mouse receiver plugged into it, the hub performed well.-Adding a thumb drive into the mix sent the mouse into intermittent communication with laptop and resulted in read times for the thumb drive reminiscent of USB 1.0, rather than the 2.0 of the drive (I can live with slow, but not a non-useable mouse).-Switching ports on the laptop and on the hub (with appropriate “eject” actions on my part each time) did not result in a fix for the intermittent mouse.-The thumb drive itself is alarmingly warm, however, the hub is not yet melting, as reported by some users.2. I read the fine print on power use. I’m not using this to charge anything - I just want an easy mouse/thumb drive hub. I was frustrated to learn (upon reading the “welcome guide” that came with the product, but *not* on the sales/web page itself) that the hub drives only 900 mA of connected devices. That means it can take one external hard drive and nothing else. Not a mouse. Not a keyboard. Nada else. So much for the advertised “Turn one of your computer's USB ports into four.”TL;DR: The un-fixable lag with just the mouse + thumb drive makes this product unusable to me.",11.0

I would have really liked for it to have a rubber bottom to keep it in one place.- Also, I really wish that the Anker was on both the top and bottom so that If I am plugging in the port on the left side of my computer, I would not see all of the regulatory writing.All in all this is another great product from Anker. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a well-made' USB hub that doesn't break the bank.",4.0

It works pretty well - the only problem I have is when the computer is on a desk with too little room, there is no place to put the data hub. In my instance however, the laptop has a raised area between the table and the bottom of the laptop that I have successfully slipped this into so that I could have multiple drives. Of course, all of this has little to do with the hub itself, just the mechanics of my setup.The hub has four outputs and one input so the power for all four must come from somewhere. In my case I purchased an express card with one USB 3.0 outputs and a cable long enough to reach another USB for the extra power needed by the 4 ports. I have successfully connected three hard drives and operated them without problems. The speed was considerably faster than I expected and one of the three was powered by the USB  hub. (That drive is a 4T Seagate 2.5"" backup drive.)Unfortunately, shortly after I got the 4T drive, I had an accident where I dumped the computer on the floor and the 4T Seagate drive went flying - landing in a pile of papers four feet away, pulling the hub, the express card and cables apart. I reassembled the forcefully disconnected setup and discovered it still worked, but something had happened in one of the USB connections during the accident because the 4T now intermittently fails to start while connected to the USB 3.0 connection. I moved it to the e-sata/USB connection and it is ok. When I get around to it, I will find out which unit is failing and fix it. There are several possibilities: the USB 3 express card, its power connector, the express card slot, the cable to the hub, the hub itself or one of its USB connectors.Except for the potential that I might have damaged it, the USB 3 hub has been a very useful addition to my system. I have not measured speeds, but the increase was noticeable and was borne out by the transfer rates shown during copies, etc.",

It's a usb hub and works right out of the box. It's pretty small about the height of an iphone 5, just slightly thicker and not as wideNothing else bad to say about the product, the only thing i can say is that manual states it is good for up to 900 mah draw combined. Which is sufficient but not optimal for charging phones and other devices.I used this for a USB memory stick and also mouse so i haven't run into any issues yet. The problem is you cannot add a power adapter to this model if you need to go with high draw devices. Anker does sell another model with power adapter so if you use high draw devices ( External HDDS, CD-ROMS, battery chargers, etc) i;d go for that model as at least you have the option to plug it in if needed.It would be nice if the standard model has a port to plug in a power adapter since it looks like it's a standard USB mini and i have those lying around already.Otherwise great product",15.0

The ports are very tight and I am only using one port to date. It has been reported in one case that only one port works but I will test that. Like other similar products it seems to be designed for laptops. The connecting wire is not long enough for ease of use on an iMac and the assembly hangs down from the rear USB3 ports without lying flat. It is still useable and very compact. The ports are spaced well which will allow me to use three license dongles and a flash drive without running into physical interference issues. This is why I purchased this product.Initially I had some concern as a result of my reading some of the other Amazon reviews of the product where some users had complained about the product heating up and in one case melting (picture included with the review). I worried because I have just purchased a new iMac (2017 5K 27”) and I wanted to be sure that there would be no issue with the iMac's USB3 sockets.It's quite possible that the overheating was caused by users trying to use the hub for charging devices like a cell phone or an iPad. It is not designed to be used for charging in this way, it's a hub for flash drives or dongles or self-powered devices that use USB3 speeds. This would explain the heat since the charging current would likely be too much for this unit. Buy a hub that's designed for charging if this is what you need.Anker support got in touch with me after reading my initial review and they were very helpful. They listened to my comments and immediately sent me a replacement which I just received. The ports are not as stiff as the first unit. I was told that they do not offer different length wires so I will use the hub as is. I was very impressed with the way they reached out to try and help. They get an extra star for that.I expect that the product will work out for me because of my modest requirements. I do not have any plans to charge anything using this hub.",

No buttons, switches, drivers or configuration.  Create 4 ports at a new location connecting with a single cable to a working USB port.  Output is USB3 provided both any connecting cable and end device are USB capable, else output will be USB2.  Input wire is relatively short so you may need a USB3 extension cable to locate this in a convenient location.Nonpowered hub means total incoming port power is split among the 4 output ports.  Attaching a USB powered high draw item on this may cause problems.  To use a high draw item, either use a splitter supplied with the item and a second USB cable or buy a powered hub instead.  A powered hub has a separate power cord that plugs into a wall outlet supplying power to attached USB devices.Unfortunately, many PCs have a limited USB power budget for all  USB ports combined.  This means that it is hard to get full USB3 level power to all the ports on the base PC.  Unless you are using all low power accessories or keep most items off most of the time, you are better off with an externally powered unit.  The radios on externally powered wireless devices, external drives and wifi units are just too much for this unit.  It may be USB3 rated, but you can not split a single USB port 4 ways and still get the power output needed for 4 USB3 ports",

The company really cares about their products and the people who buy them.  Clearly, they could have not cared, blown the whole thing off and not give it a second thought considering it is only a $10 item. NQuite the contrary...Lancky immediately offered a replacement for the hub, and it arrived directly from them this afternoon.  I am so pleased with the replacement.

The way I determine this is because the reason why I bought it was to plug into my lightning Samsung plug to have 4 Lightning Charge ports. When I plugged my phone in to the cord normally before I plugged in the device it said an 1:30 charging time give or take. So I decided to hook up the device and try it. I was really excited to get it in and to use this for this particular purpose. Well when I plugged it in the charging time doubled it was now saying it was going to take roughly 3 hours give or take for my phone to charge! I tried each port I even tried another charger plug and nothing changed. If it was a true 3.0 device it would have worked seamlessly with no effort at all it would have probably even increase the charging speed instead of decreased it! So with that being said at best this is a 2.0 Hub not a 3.0 and they knee really need to stop false advertising merchandise like this! And then when I went to get a returned it I found out there's no return policy! The sad thing is I'm normally huge Anker fan!,

I connected my wired keyboard to this hub and the keyboard would flicker on and off, and the keys would stop responding, then all of a sudden enter like 10 of the last key pressed. After trying my wireless mouse dongle, it had similar results, the mouse would stop responding for periods of 1 to 2 seconds at a time, and overall it made the mouse perform very sluggish, (this is a Logitech G900, one of the fastest wireless mouses). Unfortunately, this hub is not eligible for return, so its useless junk now.

Just enough to make a simple analysis (I did this test), when I connect my USB 3.0 hard drive with cable owner to a USB 3.0 port on my laptop (which I have done countless times) extension I've never had problems with Wi-Fi signal (connection to my router), but if I connect through this hub (just the same hard disk), this means that the hub would only work as an extension 3.0 and should not present any problem with the signal Wi- Fi from my laptop, but it presents; even if instead of connecting a hard disk, connect only one USB 3.0, the problem with my Wi-Fi signal is the same. Therefore, this means that the quality of the cable shield extension Hub is terrible, do not even support to connect a USB 3.0 to the Hub without interfering with the Wi-Fi signal, it should be noted that interference is much higher when a hard disk drive USB 3.0, because when you lose a hard disk 3.0 ""connectivity"" completely with the Wi-Fi signal from my laptop, which when connected only USB 3.0 is connected, Wi-Fi is very slow (without losing connection); to say nothing when connecting a combination of these.

I had previously bought a different USB expansion from another company and you could tell it was obviously a cheap quality device from the second you opened the package. However, this USB expansion is amazing!!! I just plugged it in and boom, it worked! The USB 3.0 has backwards capability with all the old ones like USB 2.0 and USB 1.1. The description says it has really high transfer rates (which it does with USB 3.0 devices) but that's not what I needed it for. I needed to plug in my external DVD drive, my external microphone and a wireless receiver for my XBOX 360 controller and they all work perfectly! Although I wish it came with buttons that would allow me to turn on and off specific devices, I would still highly recommend this to anyone looking for a USB expansion!

I have a wireless mouse and keyboard I connect to this dongle. All I want to do is be able to use them reliably. However, I cannot get the receivers to consistently accept input. I try to move the mouse and it just hangs there. I try to type and I have to either WAIT FOR THE LETTER TO APPEAR or constantly backspace and repeat typing. I tried connecting these directly to the computer--NO ISSUES. I also tried limiting the number of devices plugged in at once and, even with only one item, it STILL won't capture all input. - Disconnecting it from any computer and reconnecting it to another requires at all connected devices be unplugged and re-plugged into the device.- This is probably a personal thing: I had to REALLY force my USB receivers and USB keys into the ports with an uncomfortable amount of force; it really felt as though I was going to break the item.SUMMARY:If you ABSOLUTELY need a cheap USB hub that's slim and occasionally allows you to work, this is one for you. If you need to rely on it for any reason, find another USB hub.",2.0
