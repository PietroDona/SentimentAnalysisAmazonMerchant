Build: minimal - plastic build, but built with intention of minimalism. Its sleek, and it isnt just a block design, the cable leading into the hub has a curved design for when the hub is oriented sideways. There is aBlue led to show its connected. The hub us no joke... slim.3. Usage: multifarious - it works on PC, Macbook air, AND Xbox one x (my main use for it).4. Profile: matte black - blends in with a lot of standard black PC, console color schemes, blends in well.(See picture)5. Price: unbelievable - it even had 2 bucks off of its total (5.99) after coupon! Target and best buy had similar builds for 24 bucks!6. Reputation: preceding - Anker (Ankerdirect) products are known to be great products if you take care of them.Cons:1. Cable: too minimal - now days, we see these fray resistant parts that are very close to both ends of the cord. On apple, we see the white rubber, and on android, a rib-style rubber to help with cable bending at the ends.

After a week of my computer working flawlessly, I decided to try and plug these back in again.  My system once again refused to boot.  These hubs also disabled my other onboard USB ports so that I had no keyboard when booting.

My only option was my cell phone.  Of course I could tether it to my laptop, but being unsure of any tethering data limit, I wanted to keep this to a minimum.  I began looking at adapters such as this for Netflix, but never ended up getting one at the time.  So, when this came up a few months later, as a Lightning Deal, I jumped on it.I've tried it on my TV and on an ultra-wide monitor.  It works well on both.  A couple things to note:1) It leaves a black border around the edges of the screen.  I'm not sure if the Samsung adapter does this or not, as I've never tried it.  It may be normal, and it's not too big an issue for me.2) You may want to start with a fully charged battery.  The adapter seems to draw power from the phone, and drains the battery a little faster.  Also, since it's taking up your charging port, you won't be able to use a charger at the same time.  When I connected it to my TV, through my Yamaha receiver, the phone said it was connected to a charger, but it was not charging, as I watched the battery percentage drop while connected.It works well for, say, watching a movie from Netflix or Disney+, etc, as long as you start with plenty of charge, but you'll probably need to charge your device again afterward.  It may work great with a laptop.  Maybe I'll try that at a later date, in which case I'll update my review.Edit: the black border on the external display seems to be dependent on the display its connected to. One of my TVs works fine, with only a small border at the left and right edge. The one I had tried before writing the review initially had borders all the way around.

This results in poor image quality and fonts don't look smooth. Instead images and text appear more pixelated, blurry, or with ghosting edges. I bought a USB-C to DisplayPort cable instead after doing some research online suggesting that users have better luck with DisplayPort over using HDMI or adapters, and the monitor is displaying correctly using RGB from the iMac. Image quality is much better overall using a cable instead of adapter.

Note that ATMOS output doesn't work, and from iTunes even on surround content you'll only get stereo sound...but that in some apps (like HBO MAX) you can get discrete 5.1 PCM output.But let's back up.Why would you want to download content?Well, if your internet connection is not reliable (google \"digital divide\" or similar concepts; it impacts tens of millions of people in the USA, and hundreds of millions more around the world) downloading versus streaming is critical.  This isn't just a \"poor people\" problem.  Plenty of affluent rural communities are underserved, in addition to other demographics.  And, of course, if you are traveling and want to watch content on the hotel's TV, or your friend's TV or the TV at the airbnb, this is useful.So, what does this dongle do and what are the limitations?This device enables the iPad settings screen (to adjust video output) with both my LG OLED (2017 model) and my second display (Sony UHD) connected to the other end of it.  This settings screen is another section of the settings menus on the iPad itself that shows up ONLY when a compatible dongle is connected to the iPad and that dongle is connected to a compatible display.That settings screen means: I could force everything to be Dolby Vision, or HDR10, or SDR and I could also do the iOS equivalent of TVOS\u2019 features called \"match dynamic range\" and \"match frame rate\".  BUT Note that the iPad makes you choose BOTH frame rate AND dynamic range for matching. You cannot choose just one like on an Apple TV.Why does that limitation matter?  Well, 24p output is super nice with film based content.  It gives one more fidelity and fewer artifacts for film based content.  And, perhaps even more important, with the iPad Air 4th gen, and possibly some other bandwidth limited devices, 4k output is capped at 30fps.....so this is the only way to get 4k.  In other words, this feature is particularly useful because this dongle on the iPad air CANNOT output 4k 60p (60hz).  That sound like a big issue at first, but then remember that moves are 4k 24p (24hz)!  So as long as the TV accepts that kind of content, you can choose to \"match output\" and be okay......mostly.What's the problem?  Well, the way the dongle and or the ipad handle HDR output is the problem.  Read below to understand more, but in short it would be REALLY HELPFUL to be able to \"match frame rate\" and NOT also have to \"match dynamic range\".  TVOS lets you choose one or both.  Unfortunately, ipad OS (iOS) does not allow for that separation.So, in my testing, I could output 4k hdr at 24p to both displays. 60hz output was limited to 1080p but hdr would still work with the content I tried.  So if  you really want HDR (which is a little wonky, see below) and can use 24p ouput for whatever reason, that's something of an option.HOWEVER:  The Dolby Vision output is wonky or somehow otherwise non standard. The OLED didn\u2019t recognize it as hdr 2020. It tried to use sdr gamma, and the colors were completely wrong, such as black was displayed as red. Solution?  Forcing DV content to be output as hdr10 solved it......sort of.  The problem (you have already guess this?) is that to force DV content to output at HDR10 content, you have to TURN OFF the \"match content\" setting......and that means that you are turning off the 24p frame rate......and now the ipad and dongle are outputting 60p.......and that means you cannot output 4k any longer, just 1080p!  So, you can get HDR10 output onto a 2017 LG OLED but only at 60hz, and 1080p.HOWEVER:  Another DV capable display (SONY) didn\u2019t mind the DV content but perhaps not all profiles of DV work on the iPad output because it automatically output DV as hdr10 even with match content enabled and a Sony DV display.  This is important to note.  Apparently either the ipad air 4th gen or the dongle do NOT support the so called player led Dolby Vision profile (which is required by my Sony)......  The good news?  Since you have selected match content, even though the ipad and dongle decide to output DV as HDR10, you have the 24p output still......so you get the full 4k resolution of the downloaded content.  Not a perfect solution but workable.VERY BIG CAVEAT:  This dongle (or the ipad based on this dongle) forced Atmos audio in downloaded iTunes content to be 2 channel audio output from the iPad Air 4th gen.  This is a big caveat if you are wanting to hear surround sound.  However these appears to be support for 5.1 content in some apps like HBO now.  So YMMV.In summary, this is a well priced dongle.  It appears to offer the key features that the overpriced Apple branded dongle offers.  I'm giving it four stars because it would have been nice for Anker to provide more details about what is and is not supported, rather than users have to experiment themselves.", "helpfulvote": 3}, {"user": "AGKJ56WSM3N3YAIZVBDS7DANSFZQ", "asin": "B07THJGZ9Z", "rating": 5, "title": "Works on my Macbook Pro 2018", "date": "2021-03-03", "verified": true, "content": "I've been through a few different HDMI adapters. I had a JCreate from Best Buy which cost $50, and turned out to be one of the worst products I've ever purchased. No joke, I tested it, if you so much as touched it with the tip of your finger, it would disconnect. It also had USB plugs (which this does not), so if I was backing up files on an external drive I had to get up and walk away from my computer so I didn't make a slight movement and cause it to disconnect and corrupt my drive.Then I bought one of those all in one boxes that has the HDMI, USB-A, USB-C, and a few SD slots. Turned out to be a mass produced dropshipping product (Amazon is full of those these days!), and neither it or the replacement worked right.Honestly, all I wanted was something that I could plug into my monitor to give me some extra screen real estate. I can't believe how hard it is to find one of those.I decided to give this a try. I didn't trust it at first because there's no power supply. With the JCreate I had no power supply so I would constantly get errors that \"One of your accessories is taking up too much power.\" I thought I'd get the same with this, but really wanted an extra monitor to work with, so I decided to go with it. I've owned Anker problems before. I had an issue with a bluetooth keyboard a few years back and they were quick to send me a replacement.I got this, plugged it in, plugged my monitor in, and surprise! It worked. No flickering. No disconnects. No pop up errors! I've finally found the holy grail.I will say that on a very rare occasion the screen will turn off for a split second and then turn back on. But it's nothing even close to how often the JCreate did it. I can even scoot my computer without it disconnecting.Quality-wise, it's not a fancy brushed aluminum, and doesn't feel like a steel tank. I think it's just plastic, but it's good quality. The JCreate (I know I keep comparing it to that, but it was terrible), was made of metal/aluminum, but it felt like a tin box. It was so thin and cheap. This one is plastic, but it feels thick and durable. OH! Also the cord is braided to keep it fraying like Apple's and other companies are known to do.Overall, I think this is another good entry into Anker's great reputation.

I shopped around for awhile for a good quality charging cable with legit amazon reviews. I like the long length and durability of these particular cords. I especially like the lifetime warranty and strong customer service that Anker offers. I contacted the company via email last month. I have had the cords for almost 2 years and the area around the plug in had started to fray pretty badly. I figured that at least I had gotten almost 2 years out of them and I would cut my losses. I decided to contact the company just in case their claim to lifetime warranty was legit and would be honored, and I\u2019m sure glad I did! They replied to my email by the next business day and arranged for me to receive new replacement cables in the mail. I was contacted by a specific employee and not just a general mass pre-filled form email. I appreciated that. I was instructed to send pictures of the defective cables, include my amazon order number, verify the exact cables I had ordered, provide my current mailing address, and provide a couple other minor details. It was a very simple process and the communication from the company employees was top notch all along the way. The turn around time from initial contact to me receiving the replacements was about 8 business days and that is during the holiday season! I am so impressed. I know I\u2019m focusing a lot on the customer service here rather than the product in this review, but in this day and age, good customer service can be a rarity! And especially an honored warranty! It seems like companies make promises of warranties and then find any way possible to get out of honoring it. Anker is the real deal!

In the past 5 years I have purchased more than 20 cables for iPhone-all failled at some point.  Anker provides premium products at premium prices (other Anker products I purchased performed well.) So, I decided to try Anker\u2019s 2 pack of 6\u2019 lightening cables. I use 1 upstairs and 1 downstairs. The latter got more use. It failed after a few months but after the return by date. I didn\u2019t bother to do anything about it. I ate the loss.  The upstairs cable is now buzzing intermittently but has not failed completely. The downstairs cable buzzed constantly, reconnecting, disconnecting, giving \u201caccessory not supported\u201d error messages\u2014I abandoned it but did not throw the cable away. However, recently I read rave reviews about Anker customer service. People said that Anker reached out proactively to reviews revealing problems even in the absence of any attempt to return the item. They purportedly gave lifetime warranty protection on some cables. I decided to put those rave reviews to the test. I will update this review in awhile to report Anker\u2019s response, if any.UPDATE: 12-4-19 Anker Customer Service reached out to me yesterday. Replied with my shipping address. New cables on the way. I appreciate the Amazon-like laser focus on customer satisfaction and Anker\u2019s standing behind their products.Update: 12-27-19.  I gave Anker my address with their reference number and have neither heard or received anything since.UPDATE #2: 2-20-20: Gave Anker the information they requested but have not heard ANYTHING from them since. Lifetime warranty. REALLY?6-14-20 Update. In fairness to Anker I heard nothing because I provided my address by regular email instead of going to my Amazon Account Messages. Once I did they promptly responded and sent me 2 replacement cables.Would you believe that both of those cables failed right out of the box? Buzz, buzz buzz. I think Anker is finding it hard to believe also. They didn\u2019t ask me to return the original cables that I purchased but are asking me to return the replacement cables in order to receive another set of replacement cables. Their stated reason, which is understandable, is so their experts can examine the cables to see what went wrong. There is also an implication that I am lying or scamming them because they make the best cables in the world and it is inconceivable to them that 2 brand new cables could BOTH fail right out of the box\u2014but they did. To help prove my bona fides and because I have a bad habit of not throwing things away I will also send back the 2 original cables that I purchased and which were the subject of this review. Their quality control folks should have an equal interest in examining those, I would think.There is one more issue I have but won\u2019t further add to this book length review until I discuss it with Anker.

At their core, they provide good ANC, and pleasant - if a tad bassy - sound quality. That said, I'll outline the pros and cons I've observed in using them on the first day:pros:- as noted, nice sound quality, with some reinforcement in the mid-bass frequencies, but the bass is tight, and the mids and highs are mellow- almost inaudible difference to sound quality with noise cancellation enabled, and no notable hiss with ANC on- ANC is not 'make the world go away' levels, and lets some higher frequency sound through; this is great, as I am looking to cancel out midrange and bass sounds like an air conditioner, nearby dogs, and the wearing rumble of airplane engines during long flights- aside from the slightly too small earcups (for my tastes), they are comfortable to wear - neither too loose nor too tight- the various audible and voice prompts are pleasant and at a reasonable volumecons:- big problem: can't charge and listen at the same time- big problem: no ability to use as a phone headset in wired mode (these are headphones only when used with the cable, with no mic available)- the earcup material is too insulative, resulting in unpleasant warmth and sweating under fairly normal circumstances (74F / 45% RH, just sitting at computer doing work, so these would suck for truly warm, humid, and and/or strenuous activity)- when switching ANC on and off, the enhanced bass enables momentarily, which is just sloppy design, and rather jarring- they have stiff creaky hinges and pivots, which is emblematic of inexpensive plastic-on-plastic construction- they have a light but unpleasant chemical smell, which I suspect is from the earcup material, and it's not dissipating any too quickly- a general lack of build refinement - they're nice enough, but the point where the earcup cushions meet the body was wrinkled and unevenly finishedAll this said, I can't really recommend these, since I think refinement and solid build quality should be reasonable expectations at a $70 price point. If I could give them 3.5 stars, I would, but since their core functionality is great, I'll go with 4 stars instead of 3.", "helpfulvote": 1925}, {"user": "AHPDOKKAVJVJ7E6AM6543GEOCGRQ", "asin": "B07NM3RSRQ", "rating": 5, "title": "Anker soundcore life Q20", "date": "2019-08-21", "verified": true, "content": "The Anker Soundcore Life Q20 bluetooth headphones are not what I had expected from a $60 pair of headphones. The sound, the weight, the build quality, and the style are all something to appreciate from this pair of headphones. If you are looking for an expensive sounding pair of headphones for a small price look no further. I will go over all of the specs of the headphones in detail below.General SpecsLets start with what these headphones have to offer. The first item to note about these headphones is that they have bluetooth 5.0. This means their range is ridiculously far and they are low energy data transfer headphones. This is how this pair of headphones packs a 30 hour battery life with all the extras turned on. You can get up to 60hours if you have a couple features turned off and don't need the volume very loud. They offer noise cancelation and a bass boost function. The padding around your ear is memory foam and my favorite part is that it actually goes around your ear and does not sit on it. They are light and have great sound. The bass is the most impressive part of these headphones. People that do not want bass may want to stay clear of these, but from my testing I really enjoyed the sound. They came with an auxilary cable, charging cable, and a carry pouch.SoundLets talk about the sound features. The normal sound out of the box is great. if you are bass heavy and want more, they have a bass up feature that really hits. They offer noise canceling to drown out background noises. With bass up and noise canceling on, this is where you get up to 30 hours of battery life. If you don't use these features you can get yourself up to 60 hours of battery. I personally have not needed the noise canceling feature yet and I feel like the sound in normal mode is great. I have easily gotten 40 hours out of these headphones. Louder volumes will affect the battery life as well. If you are an audiofile you may have different opinions than me, but I think these sound as good as Beats or other $100 plus headphones.Build QualityThese headphones are light and of course they adjust for different head sizes. They don't feel cheap, which I like. The memory foam cushion around the ears is comfortable. The thing I like the most is the fact that they are big enough togo around my ears instead of sitting on my ears like other headphones do. These are very comfortable well built headphones.ConclusionThe Anker Soundcore Life Q20 are a great pair of headphones. In my personal opinion they provide the sound a more expensive option would provide. They are comfortable and have great battery life. I would suggest this pair of headphones to anyone looking for an affordable but expensive sounding pair of headphones.", "helpfulvote": 887}, {"user": "AG26JZBCW7MU7PFN3PJ4NVIWRXCA", "asin": "B07NM3RSRQ", "rating": 4, "title": "Exceptional for the price", "date": "2019-09-05", "verified": true, "content": "I own a pair of Bose QC 25 headphones which I enjoy thoroughly.  They are my go to headphones in almost every situation whether studying at home or on a plane.  This noise cancellation with the Bose QC 25 is good, but not as good as the QC 35.  However, the sound quality of Bose is fantastic in my opinion and I have several additional pair of Bose headphones that I use at the gym and as a back up pair.  I've even converted my wife to Bose quality.  That being said, i needed a pair of headphones to use at work to drown out the noise while working at the computer and I didn't want to take the risk of my Bose being damaged or growing legs and walking away.  Unfortunately I have very high quality standards but a limited budget, so I tried to find something that would meet my needs while not breaking the bank.  Enter the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 headphones.  Bought from Amazon at around the $50 mark, I figured that the Anker quality would make them durable, but I wasn't convinced that the sound quality and noise cancellation would even compare to my Bose.  I can wholeheartedly say that I was wrong.  The build is actually better than my Bose.  Very solid and yet modernly styled and not bulky.  While the sound is not Bose by any means, it is exceptional for this price point.  Not a big fan of the bass boost as it makes the totality of the music more subdued and somewhat detracts from the overall quality.  Without the bass boost, I found that the sound quality is well rounded and has enough punch so that it doesn't feel lacking at any range.  The noise cancellation is quite good, but doesn't rival the QC 35, which to me is the standard for higher end headphones.  With just the noise cancellation on it does make a noticeable difference in quieting conversations in the office around me, but still allows overly loud conversations to seep through.  With noise cancellation and music together, the noises fade away and are almost undetectable.  The included carry bag is decent quality, but seems a little small for the headphones and cords as the headphones seem to slightly stick out of the top of the bag.  With the draw string pulled together, it tucks the headphones away in the bag but has a tendency to compress the ear cups, which I believe over time may limit their life span, resulting in a need for replacement.  Overall, while not $300 headphones, they are surprisingly robust in almost every facet and make a great choice for those on a budget who wish to enjoy some of the benefits of the higher priced headphones while not breaking the bank.", "helpfulvote": 385}, {"user": "AFFAEMMM2742WLKZX4XR23OFQYIQ", "asin": "B07NM3RSRQ", "rating": 4, "title": "Good value for the price", "date": "2019-08-26", "verified": true, "content": "Pros: great battery life, low priceCons: noise cancellation is decent but not great, ear cups trap heatI fly a few times a year and commute ok public transit most days. I have a nice pair of IEMs that I use for long haul flights but prefer wireless headphones for my regular commute. These headphones do a decent job reducing train & ambient noise but you can still hear the outside world (it's a good amount quieter, but definitely still there). Another minor issue with these - when I wear these headphones for more than 2 hours at a time, my ears get a little sweaty. This isn't a problem on airplanes (because it tends to be so cold) but out and about I did notice it.On flights my in ear monitors do a better job blocking out the engine noise and are much better at blocking out voices (especially crying infants, which the soundcore Q20 isn't great at blocking). Still, the Q20 is good enough that it's going to replace my expensive IEMs on shorter flights.Battery life is probably the strongest argument in favor of the Q20 - I've been using them for my daily commute + a roundtrip flight over the last 2 weeks and still am going off the initial charge. I've never owned wireless headphones with such good battery life.Overall given the $50-60 price point, sound quality is slightly better than I expected, noise cancelling is decent but not great, and battery life has really impressed me. If you're looking for quiet on long flights this probably isn't your best bet, but for daily use and the occasional <4 hour flight, these are great.", "helpfulvote": 368}, {"user": "AFEYM2LPHXWAMWFUW45ATGHD6EMQ", "asin": "B07NM3RSRQ", "rating": 4, "title": "Audiophile Review (sort of)", "date": "2019-09-06", "verified": true, "content": "Full disclosure, I'm not exactly a full-blown audiophile. However, I couldn't seem to find anything resembling a more audio-quality focused review for these on head-fi and other sites, so I figured I'd do a brief(ish) sound overview.Going into this I wasn't expecting much, and to be honest, I didn't get much. But I'll try to convince you why that's okay, and these are still a pretty good buy, imo.The following is for the \"normal\" EQ mode, which in reality isn't all that normal whatsoever. Tests were done using lossless FLAC files through a mid-range DAC. Whether or not you believe in burn-in, I did let them play for a little while before doing any testing.Starting at the low end, it's a bassy mess. Sub-bass is actually alright, maybe slightly overtuned.  Mid-bass becomes a terribly bloated, muddy monstrosity and to add insult to injury, it's boosted to appalling amounts. Very unpleasant.Lower mid to midrange follows similarly and sounds slightly closed. Moderate to severe congestion issues with bass, and it even bleeds a bit into higher mids and presence range as well. As a result, vocals are less than desirable. Everything sounds relatively laid-back even at high volume.Also, there's an AWFUL sibilance somewhere around 2k-3kHz, leading some hi-hats to sound almost like white noise.The highs beyond that are just decent. They can get a little glassy and bright but they hold up nicely otherwise.Overall, these headphones have a complete disregard for balance (which I expected) and hold a very typical V shaped signature. Clarity is barely passable, and soundstage is unimpressive. After a bit of EQ, they do sound better, but of course, that is up to the user.No type of aptX seems to be supported. Audio performance is slightly (yet noticeably) better wired, but Bluetooth connectivity is great and hissing is kept to an impressive minimum. The bass boost function is there, but why anyone would choose to use it is beyond me. The ANC is alright; it doesn't do the sound quality any favors.So far the review been pretty negative, but keep in mind the price and intended purpose. For a pair of $60 Bluetooth cans from a company that's basically still a baby in the audio industry, these are honestly not bad. What they lack in sound they make up for in build quality, comfort, and ease of use. I bought these to use on the subway, walking down the street, etc. and they perform very well in those environments. They were never meant to be studio monitors. The ear cushions are very soft and offer many hours of listening before getting uncomfortable/hot. Media and volume controls are tactile and easy to use. Construction is solid - creaking/microphonics at the hinges are not present when moving around. If you're using these outside or near other people, chances are that the surrounding environmental noise will cover up the sub-stellar audio quality anyways, even with the ANC on. At the end of the day, I'd still recommend these for anyone who wants a comfortable and convenient pair of wireless headphones. They feel very nice, and even smell kind of nice right out of the box.", "helpfulvote": 239}, {"user": "AE3LJMTUU6T72BVAOMKFLDDAY3VA", "asin": "B07NM3RSRQ", "rating": 1, "title": "Greater Cons than Pros", "date": "2019-09-15", "verified": true, "content": "Trusting other ANKER products, I thought these would be a strong purchase.

Where it all went wrong was when I put them on before jogging down my stairs. Every step caused a loud popping sound. I thought maybe it was the connection at first, pulled out my phone, disconnected, and reconnected. Same thing. I turned off the ANC, and no more popping. Turned ANC back on, did a couple small jumps barely leaving the ground, and there it was again. I then shook my head back and forth and the popping occurred every time my head changed direction.

My other set of over the ear Anker headphones (Soundcore Vortex) need to be at basically full volume to hear the music while mowing. These do not need to be thanks to the hybrid active noise cancellation. I also really like the folding design of these. I wish they came with a better case though as I plan on taking them to Europe. A hard case would be better for a carry on plane ride to protect them. That is really my only big complaint.  The bass up feature is neat and works pretty well if you are into that. The battery life is amazing on these as well. I have had them for a week with daily usage and no charges yet! Overall I am very satisfied with the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 headphones.

These headphones have a good V shaped sound. I looked up the frequency response on rtings.com as well. Bass was soild and treble seems good but not too bright. Middle frequencies didn't seem recessed even with pronounced Bass and highs. I'd say they sounded pretty good for $60. In that group (budget) of over the ear headphones, they sounded above average. But you could tell it wasn't stellar, and that's fine for $60. I was happy with the sound.However, I returned them. Why? It's simple really.1. Clamp force is weak. Instantly upon putting them on my head I felt a sagging feeling. Weight was hanging down in the ears. This was because the clamp force combined with the dimensions. Slight head movements and they slip around or off your head. I was unable to tighten the head clamp either! It was fully closed so I could not tighten the fit. My head is above average large too! Always has been. So the fit and sizing of the head band is just way to big. Not doable.2. Within minutes my ears were hot. The memory foam pads are comfy but way to warm. These headphones use actual memory foam. They get hot, just like all memory foam products. Other workable foams are available Anker. Why use something that makes your ears feel like they are in a heater? Not doable.Anker came close with the sound but fit and feel is off. It's a shame really.I'm not willing to put up with B+ sound for a set of headphones that hang heavy on my ears, slip with causual movements and heat up my ears like little heat packs.Three stars is being generous just because they sound decent.

I use a lot of headphones.  I'm an IT guy, and I work in an office that can be noisy, also due to our friend COVID, I am on a TON of conference calls, all the time.  I thought I'd rate all of the headphones that I've purchased recently, and post this review into each of the products so that folks can learn from my experience.In the last year or so, I've purchased and regularly use these 4 sets of over the ear headphones: - Bose QC 35 II - Anker Soundcore Q20 - MPOW H12 - TaoTronics Sound Surge 60Yes, all but the Bose are budget headphones.  So how do they compare?  I will rate each on according to what is important to me (these 5 things): 1. Comfort 2. Music fidelity (sound quality) 3. Audio call performance (specifically in a noisy environment) 4. Noise cancelling performance 5. Bang for the buck=== BOSE QC 35 ===1. Comfort  The Bose are the most comfortable.  I can literally wear them as long as I want. (Note: I wear glasses 100% of the time)2. Music fidelity  The Bose sound the best.3. Audio calls  This is where the Bose take a giant, steaming, smelly dump.  Using the Bose for calls in a noisy environment is horrible.  The ANC actually reverts to a noise pick up, so you, and everyone on the call can hear EVERYTHING around you.  I cannot use these for calls in anything but the most serene environment, and even when I do, I hate the way the ANC turns off.  There is a lot on the internet about this, and I would guess that Bose could fix it with a firmware update, but I am afraid they've moved on to the 700 and their future models.  I am thoroughly perturbed by how crappy this is.4. NC performance  The Bose excel here, and are the best of the bunch.5. Bang for the buck  POOR.  BY FAR the most expensive set here, and everything is worth it, but the mic/call performance totally kill it for me.  Over the last year I've become more and more disappointed in the value of these headphones.=== Anker Soundcore Q20 ===1. Comfort  The Anker's are very comfortable, not quite as good as the Bose, but a tie for a close second with the TaoTronics Sound Surge 602. Music fidelity  The worst of the bunch.  They sound decent, but DEFINITELY not audiophile stuff...3. Audio calls  The best of the bunch.  Folks can hear me well, I can hear them, and they handle a noisy environment VERY well.4. NC performance  Again, the worst.  NC works decent, but there is an audible hiss.  A plus tho, NC works on calls seamlessly.5. Bang for the buck  Good.  A decent budget headphone, ESPECIALLY if you make a lot of calls.  These are my goto for phone calls in the office.  Not as good if you are just listening to music.=== MPOW H12 ===1. Comfort  Decent, but are the last of the bunch.  They were pinching my glasses arms after a couple of hours, although I've put them on a stand to widen the band and this has gotten much better.  Also heavier than the others.2. Music fidelity  Very Good.  Second to the Bose.3. Audio calls  Decent, but the mic picks up more noise than the Ankers, not NEARLY like the Bose though.4. NC performance  Great.  A close second to the Bose, and at a FRACTION of the cost.5. Bang for the buck  AWESOME, due to the great sound/ANC and decent phone call capability.=== Tao Tronics Sound Surge 60 ===1. Comfort  Great.  Tied with the Ankers as a close second to Bose.2. Music fidelity  Good.  Very close to the MPOWs3. Audio calls  Unknown.  I've been on a lot of calls, but at home where it's quiet.  This pair has not been in noisy environments.  Mic performance has been good in the quiet.4. NC performance  Good, but a slight audible hiss.  NC works great on calls.5. Bang for the buck  Very good.  A good sounding headphone with decent call performance and ANC for a budget.

That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.Active Noise Cancellation:Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..Sound:I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..Quality:The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!Functionality:A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!Battery:The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!Packaging:The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..Overall:Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price..

First of all I\u2019m not going to overly elaborate like some others who seem to enjoy making rave reviews. This is specifically whether these are a value for $50. Let me start with the Cons but be known that this is also based on my expectation from other reviews and my personal opinion how they work for me. Anyone else may have a different experience based on previous products they\u2019ve owned. Far as the 5 star reviews go these are not 5 star headphones however....Pros and Cons:1.) limited Bluetooth signal distance for 5.0 I had expected more from them. Compared to a pair of Bluetooth 4.2 these cut out at the exact same distance so I highly doubt these offer true to signal Bluetooth 5.0.I do use these at work in a 3,000 sqft building with brick walls and steel roof. The headphones will work from one end to the other but stop immediately when I walk out to toss the trash. My bludio victory headphones actually make it the extra 20 feet with Bluetooth 4.2 but my Bludio ufo set stops working before I get halfway through the building. The Pro is that the headphones auto connect when you walk back in and my Bludio victory set would require physical reconnection.2.) ANC noise canceling. Far as noise canceling it\u2019s not perfect but it does work. For the price range it probably works better than others I\u2019ve used even slightly more expensive headphones. While it is still only 3 stars I\u2019ve had $100 sets that didn\u2019t get 1 star.The noise canceling around cnc machinery gets rid of all the low bass hum. It will not do anything for fan noise or higher pitches so be aware it\u2019s focus is on the sounds that drive you nuts after awhile or give a migraine.3.) The build quality is ok but I suspect they won\u2019t last longer than a year. Sound is good but in no way are these as good as some boast about. Night high resolution and likely use a mid size driver so bass suffers along with the varying degree of frequencies commonly heard through a quality set like nose. ive had $30 headphones that sounded better. That said they\u2019re not bad and the other features balance it enough for my needs these are a good headphone at work. Going back to the anc certain things will trigger added static noise and they are succumb to static or emf frequencies so keep in mind if they crackle or hiss you may have to shut noise cancelling off.Overall I give these 3.5 stars. The volume is a Big plus and they get plenty loud for my environment while the distance usage is perfect for my environment. The sound is not overly muddled so it\u2019s not annoying to listen through.and comfort enough to wear for a 12 hour shift. I think they are exactly what you pay for and nothing more so don\u2019t let your expectations be too high and realize these are not as amazing as others claim. A good overall headphone for work, exercise, lawn mowing, or flying. If you\u2019re an audiophile spend at least $150 and you will be much happier.", "helpfulvote": 18}, {"user": "AE6NB6SWOORHNBDSS6223JZNU5ZQ", "asin": "B07H256MBK", "rating": 1, "title": "Snapped", "date": "2019-12-28", "verified": true, "content": "Please let me start with how much I LOVE Anker products.

My first impression wasn\u2019t so excited however. Not only does the cable look more like a dark grayish green but it feels stiffer than a piece of spaghetti in a snowdrift. Seriously it is the stiffest cable I\u2019ve ever seen.Aside from not being especially aesthetic nor user friendly how well it works becomes a moot point, it\u2019s a cable after all and these days they either work or they don\u2019t. This one works and it serves its purpose despite Anker\u2019s decision to charge us a little more for it because it\u2019s not plain white.I give them kudos for choosing to make a cable in a highly unusual color even if I was expecting something with more pizzazz but I\u2019m not so good with how inflexible it is. Nice but not a home run.[INCOMPATIBILITY REPORT] the new Midnight Green cable (which is really a dark grayish green) for me has an incompatibility issue with my iPad Pro 10.5 - my device reports that it is not supported and it won\u2019t charge.  I contacted Anker\u2019s tech support and they were not very helpful, they told me my new iPad probably has a dirty charging port, despite me telling them that it charges perfectly with my white Anker cable and that the green cable works perfectly with my iPhone XS Max.Dealing with Anker\u2019s technical support has really gone downhill lately.  Even though I contacted them using the seller messaging link which proved I had just bought the cable they didn\u2019t believe me and I was required to send them either the serial number from the product or a photo of it to prove I actually had it, then they agreed to replace it but only if I would return the defective one to prove I wasn\u2019t trying to pull something. That\u2019s a lot of inconvenience to me for something that they messed up on.  Coincidentally I had just ordered a Belkin USB-C charger and lightning cable and it works perfectly and the cable is much more flexible.[ANOTHER UPDATE] the rating of this cable remains high. While dealing with Anker isn't quite as smooth as it was when they were a small company to their credit they did come through and replace my cable and no longer requested that I send the defective one back. I threw it away because I suspect there is a broken internal wire and I've heard stories about bad charging cables starting fires. I still would prefer a more flexible cable so the best I can do is four stars for this green cable.", "helpfulvote": 83}, {"user": "AHQIXSCKT7VU3Z4F6TJLLREFODIA", "asin": "B07H256MBK", "rating": 1, "title": "Horrible cable", "date": "2020-10-09", "verified": true, "content": "In a couple of months the connector stopped working properly.

Turns out Anker went from a ring of light around the bottom of the charger to a single tiny LED which, after positioning 180\u00b0 away from the bed hasn't been an issue.At just 2.33 oz, 12mm at its thickest point, and about 98mm (3 7/8\") in diameter its a thinner but slightly wider than my old charger, but still easily small/light enough to slip into your pocket or bag and forget its there.While the charger's sleek appearance is visually appealing I did wonder about my phone sliding off accidentally. Anker had that covered though giving it what seems to be a rubberized surface on the top and bottom which keeps your phone and the charger from sliding around. So far I've used the charger with the Galaxy s7 the Note 9 - both in otterbox like cases - without any issues, so that isn't a concern.Don't forget, how fast this charges depends on the A/C adapter you plug it into, so choose wisely. Anker makes some good ones, along with plenty of other companies, but the one that came with your phone should work pretty well too.

The repair is covered by AppleCare but guess what - the data recovery by the third party repair shop is not covered by AppleCare (Apple says they care too much about privacy to offer this service -_-). And data recovery is needed because the genius bar rep told me if it's a logic board issue, it's 100% chance of data loss without a data recovery because the hard drive is sodered to the logic board.The guy at the genius bar said he has seen multiple cases where Anker hubs caused this specific issue in MacBook Pros. It just so happens that I also used this hub. Apparently there is a Big Sur update that solves the problem because the Anker devices aren't properly regulating the amount going into the computer. But Big Sur has compatibility problems so I don't want to upgrade.The data recovery bill is going to be $700-2700, not covered by Apple, and now I will have to buy a different brand of USB hub (I bought two Anker hubs because historically I have liked their quality).

Decent transfer speeds over USB.Power delivery is fine, but it\u2019s worth noting that when I first got this, I plugged in my 30W charger and it only delivered 15W.  After messaging Anker, they promptly replied and informed me that the charger has a 15W overhead, and suggested I try a 45 or 60W charger.  I ordered one and just tested it out and my MacBook detects 45W of power, so all is good.While it makes sense that a hub would consume some power, 15W seems high, but it does seem to work fine now.  I told them it would be helpful to have this clearly indicated on the product listing though.Overall, despite a false start, I\u2019m pleased with this hub, and with Anker\u2019s excellent customer service.

HDMI out to a 34\" ultra widescreen 2440x1080 monitor is great, although it caps the refresh at 60hz from my Chromebook, and oddly, the Mac says it's 59.97hz, but that's more than good enough for basic productivity.  Logitech Unified receiver is picked up promptly by both devices once plugged in.  Haven't tried the USB-C data port yet, but I'm assuming it will work well.The hub gets only slighty warm even when using to charge devices and transfer data, which is better than I expected, since similar products' reviews complained about heat.

I don't have USB C capable power meters and was unable to verify this, so I can only trust that I wasn't sent the older model.Beyond the misprint regarding power, the following reasons negatively influenced my rating:1) This hub is only convenient for laptops/devices with USB C ports on the left-hand side. On the Surface Pro 7, the USB C port is on the right, such that the HDMI cable sticks straight out towards the user instead of backwards where it belongs. Same goes for the PD port. My non-solution was to use the hub upside down, which is inconvenient itself.2) Possibly unique to the Surface Pro 7, the USB C port is located unusually high up off the table, such that the short 6-inch cable of this hub causes it to dangle partway rather than lie flat on the table. There are probably technical reasons for its short length, but it is nevertheless a problem.It may be unfair for me to penalize this product for what are essentially design choices, but why not produce a version with opposite port configurations for the rest of us? Without many options I can't influence companies via purchasing decisions, so I'll complain in public reviews.----------------Original Review:I bought this updated hub and the previous model (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HMLTCPL) days apart for comparison but received two identical products. Same product numbers on back of devices (1H2C2A1S1M) and same manual stating 20 W power usage (this should be 15 W according to description on this page).

It was initially thought that my power supply wasn't powerful enough to support the accessories I was plugging into the Hub Adapter.  Anker support pointed me to a power supply they recommended I use with the adapter and even provided a small rebate after I purchased it.  This did not resolve the issue and they escalated internally.Eventually it was discovered that the USB-C port on this hub is made for data transfer only so USB-C monitors will not work.  There is mention of this in the manual.  I suspect there may be other USB-C peripherals that wouldn't work with this hub so keep that in mind when considering this product.I have to give credit to Anker's support team:  They have continued to follow up on this for weeks after my purchase to make sure everything that could be done was done.  I am adding another star to my review based on their excellent customer support.*Original Review Below*A good looking product that appears to be well built.  Unlike the other many Anker products I own, they missed the mark on functionality.I like the size and ports available on this model.  It's ruggedly built and I'm sure it would hold up over time.It just falls flat in functionality and usage.1.  15Watt overhead power usage seems excessive.

Unfortunately, after a brief test, the Anker PowerExpand+ also fails to make the grade in terms of power delivery.The Anker PowerExpand+ is a large, hefty, expensive unit ($30-plus dollars U.S.) featuring a metal top-surface veneer and a plastic body. The PowerExpand+ is packaged securely and comes with a synthetic carrying case - a nice touch. The Anker adaptor features 7 ports total: 2 USB C ports, 1 HDMI port, 2 SD Card ports, and two USB A ports. One of the USB C ports functions as power delivery and is unobtrusively marked PD, while the other USB C port is data-only. The Anker adaptor appears well-made, with no obvious exterior flaws. The ports of the Anker adaptor appear to work without much fuss - even when used simultaneously.Anker claims in its advertising on Amazon.com that this unit provides power pass-through: \"Connect a Power Delivery charger to the USB-C port to give your laptop a continuous charge up to 85W while transferring files or streaming media.\" If this is true, then an Anker 63 Watt charger should correspondingly provide a 48 Watt pass-through charge when connected to the Anker PowerExpand (PowerExpand adaptor requires 15 Watts to function). Multiple sources indicate that a 45 Watt power brick, when functioning properly, will induce \"Fast Charging\" in a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE tablet computer. Unfortunately, this is not the case with regard to the Anker PowerExpand adaptor.When the Anker adaptor is connected to my tablet computer and powered by my brand-new Anker Quick Charge 63 Watt Wall Charger, my tablet actually loses power when utilizing the USB port for flash drive access. That's right, folks: When I am using my tablet with the Anker PowerExpand connected and a USB flash drive plugged into the port, my tablet's battery continues to drain. Most assuredly, the tablet's battery would drain down to 0% if I continued the configuration and usage pattern.When disconnecting the Anker PowerExpand adaptor and plugging in a USB C cable which is directly connected to my 63 Watt power-brick, the tablet immediately proceeds to Fast-Charge without any noticeable lag. Most people would consider this an obvious waste of money - and I would have to agree.Once again, I will not be returning this item - although I should. I will add it to my growing USB C hub collection. For me, the primary purpose of this purchase was to keep my tablet's battery recharged, powered-on and powered-up while utilizing peripheral devices and ports. For that purpose alone, the Anker USB C Hub PowerExpand+ 7-in-1 fails spectacularly. Shame on you, Anker. Tsk, tsk.3 out of 5 stars.- Chipper F.

Granted, this is mostly my fault, since I failed to read the fine print and simply purchased a \"qi wireless charger\" to use with my new phone. I don't blame Anker for this, quite the opposite: I actually blame Google, who have locked down wireless Rapid Charging and are only allowing their own dock to use Rapid Charging technology. This is the same anti-consumer garbage in which Apple has long engaged (though ironically not with these Qi Wireless chargers; go figure), and I'm disappointed to see Google fall to its lure as well. But I digress.This particular Anker unit charges my phone, albeit \"slowly\". The real problem, however, is that the charger seems nearly wholly incompatible with the Pixel in specific. It says it's charging the phone but my battery continues to drain at the same rate as if it weren't docked at all. Furthermore, it has serious stability issues; I'll leave my phone docked for a few minutes and it all-of-a-sudden loses connection and halts charging the phone despite my not having touched the dock or the phone. Very disappointing.I've actually purchased another Qi Wireless Charging Stand of a different make (made by LK), and while it displays that it charges \"slowly\" like this Anker unit does, it actually DOES charge my phone and features none of the connectivity issues the Anker unit does. I'm not sure if this is due to a different design, or what, but this Anker unit is nothing more than a paperweight, which is disappointing. I would expect it at the very least to charge my phone, and I could even live with a slow charging rate if it was something I could set my phone on while I work. Seeing as it fails to do even that, it is basically an expensive paperweight, and I've actually just thrown it in the trash.This could have been avoided had I paid more attention to the fine print or done my research beforehand, so rather than 1-star I typically give to a useless product, I'll give Anker 3-stars so I don't drag the product rating down too much. By all accounts it seems a fine product for other devices, but buyers need to be warned before falling into the same trap I have an purchasing it for their Pixel phone.12/23/18 Edit: An Anker customer service representative reached out to my on their own account after seeing this review, offered me a full refund.", "helpfulvote": 635}, {"user": "AGU6CUBJZOQ2XICQSHB2AA37XYTA", "asin": "B07DBXZZN3", "rating": 5, "title": "Worked great for a little less than a month", "date": "2018-11-12", "verified": true, "content": "I have a Pixel 3XL and this charger worked great, but now when i put the phone on the charger it was start to charge, then stop and the blue LED on the front of the stand will start to blink.

Using this card reader, I was able to plug her Micro SD into my computer, and, with the card still in the reader, ran a data recovery program that rebuilt all her photos that weren't corrupted. The reader got warm from the process (file recovery takes a couple hours and strains the drive that the data is on), but this little guy held in there like a pro. My girlfriend ended up not losing a single file.Like I said, I don't use card readers very often any more, but this is one of those things that I feel like everyone should have in case of an emergency, like needing to download photos after a digital camera's computer cable is lost, or when you need to get files off an Android.

I needed to use the card, so I formatted it anyway.My later investigation showed that the older reader was not compliant with SDXC format. This is why I did not see exFAT formatting option (and size larger than 32 GB) in the Windows formatting options. So I, naturally, went to Amazon.com and ordered this SDXC-compliant card reader.However, my Windows 10 still showed 32GB for the 64GB card even with this SDXC-compliant reader. This is where I called Anker support.After a short wait, Ashley from support started investigating the situation. Pretty quickly she found a link to SanDisk Knowledge Article about recovering \"lost\" memory from the card and emailed it to me. I downloaded the formatter from SanDisk and re-formatted the card to 59+ GB.I have bought Anker products in the past, but had not called their support. Now I feel pretty comfortable troubleshoot any issues -- their support is fo premium quality!P.S. If you are wondering why the 64GB card's actual size is just 59+ GB, Google this question for a detailed explanation. The gist is that Windows \"interprets\" \"kilo\" in \"kilobyte\" as the exponent value for the base of 2 rather than it's metric system's meaning as 1000 bytes. Following the same logic, it interprets Gigabyte to mean 2^30, i.e. 1024x1024x1024 = 1073741824 bytes.At the same time, SanDIsk interprets \"Giga\" according to metric system, and it's 64GB = 64,000,000,000 bytes. If you divide this value by 2^30, you will get 59.6 GB in the Microsoft system of measurement.", "helpfulvote": 77}, {"user": "AE34P4Z4P3WJ7J2FFRY7SKT2OE5Q", "asin": "B006T9B6R2", "rating": 4, "title": "Great Product but Laptop users be aware.....", "date": "2017-01-08", "verified": true, "content": "Works great :) I bought Anker because I trust Anker.

Now I got it!For less than $10.00, Anker delivers a fast, extremely portable reader.  The black glossy finished reader came in the standard Anker packaging. Out of the box, the reader is a plug and use device. Just place it into your USB port on your computer and the drivers will automatically install (Windows).  When placing it into my Macbook Pro, I was able to use immediately.The reader itself is VERY small, lightweight, and portable.  (I did not want to have to find a place in my laptop bag to fit a bulkier one).  To display the size itself, see the photo I included comparing it to a SD card.I have only tested this product with SD cards, not Micro SD cards.  Once you insert the reader, a blue light in the corner of the reader will signal on indicating that it is attached.  Using two different SD cards with different speeds (SanDisk ExtremePLUS 32gb, SanDisk UltraPLUS 32gb), I transferred 10gb of data at one time.  EACH of these transfers were extremely fast. Obviously the different card speeds displayed different times, however each were completed within minutes (whereas usually I would have started the transfer and got up to do something else).  When ejecting the SD card, the blue light blinks indicating that you are doing so.The only con I have noticed is that when using the product on my Windows computer, I had to wait a minute before the SD cards would be recognized.  Almost like the reader had to \"warm up\".  I tried multiple USB 3.0 ports to see if this would change and it did not.  This a minor con, however I wanted other consumers to be aware in case this happens to them.  Note:  This did not happen on my Mac.Overall this is a great little product.  I would recommend to anyone who would like a portable SD card reader.  Of course make note that this only supports SD and Micro SD, so if you are using a different kind, then this isn't for you.

The packaging the device came in was a refreshing change.  Instead of that usual crusty, hard shrink-plastic that has to be cut and pryed apart it came in a simple 2-piece clamshell plastic that popped apart very easily.A few downsides:1.  The device is bigger than a USB slot (I knew this before I bought it so it wasn't an issue for me) which means that if you have USB slots directly next to each other this can interfere with your ability to use both ports at the same time.  I currently have mine plugged into the tail end of a USB hub so it isn't blocking 2 ports.  My laptop has just the one USB 3.2 port by itself on the right side and two USB 2.0 ports on the other side so I don't have any issues there but only because it has just the one USB 3.0 port.2.  The device creates a bridge drive when plugged in.  That is the Device becomes a Drive (Letter J: for me on my desktop) and then splits itself between 2 additional drives for both the MicroSD and SD slots (Drives K: and L: on my desktop respectively).

The Uni cables I own are pretty thick, woven cable sheath. Similar to this Anker cable but thicker.It turns out that in a 10ft cable, thicker is better if you are going to be putting it away in a bag. Coiling it up and uncoiling it repeatedly means a thick cable won't kink up easily and will lie flat when unrolled.This cable is long enough and thin enought that it unfortunately kinks up a bit. Not much! but even one kink when unrolling it is inconvenient and makes me concerned that over time this may result in some twisting or excessive wear of the cable interior.I don't love how thick the other usb-c cables (the non anker cables) I own are.

They really take this stuff seriously, and I was happy to have someone to work with (thanks, Sunny!). They swapped in a new Q30 headset that seems to have a better mic than my original. They also gave me some steps to take on my Windows 10 PC to help get the most out of Bluetooth (this made a big difference). I personally don't think the mic on the Q30 is quite as good as my Q20, but  it's definitely good enough that people can hear me and I'm no longer getting complaints for my co-workers. That's a win and I'm upgrading my star rating accordingly. Buy with confidence.---------ORIGINAL REVIEW-----------I own two Q10 sets, one Q20 set, and now one Q30 set of headphones. I jumped on the new model after being reasonably satisfied with my Q20, and seeing that several upgrades had been made, including a much-needed move from micro-USB to USB-C.  There's never been a \"perfect pair of headphones,\" no matter your manufacturer, but I did expect Soundcore to do better or at least as well in every category. Unfortunately, this is not the case.SHORT REVIEW: Though they feel great, sound great, and will last for days, ultimately what caused me to give them 3 stars out of 5 is the call quality. The microphone has some real problems. I spent some time with co-workers comparing what I sound like using my Q20 versus my Q30, and they all told me I sound like I'm \"in a box\" when using my Q30s. They're \"too quiet,\" \"muffled,\" \"weird,\" and \"unnatural sounding\" compared with the Q20. As I'm using these for work, and a lot of what I do involves videoconferencing, the quality of my mic is very important to me. As such, I've gone back to my Q20 for daily work. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my Q30 yet.", "helpfulvote": 178}, {"user": "AHNQAZIO3MSAIUUCIJ7TXG5L6CKA", "asin": "B08HMWZBXC", "rating": 5, "title": "Addressing the top reviews", "date": "2021-06-09", "verified": true, "content": "To address the top reviews here:- The first review complains about the volume of the voice when switching between modes.

Build quality is not that of 80$, or even 50$ in my opinion. Used these for a few hours and the sound is great, but too many major cons for me to keep and enjoy using them.Pros-Preorder discount.-Sound. Great sound. Nice punchy bass and lows.-App. Soundcore app is very easy to use. Can change NC and EQ settings instantly.-It comes with a case. This should be a standard. Instead of tossing in some drawstring bag that just gets dirty like other companies, this soft-shell case will definitely provide enough protection in carry-ons or sliding around the backseat of a car.Cons-I might have gotten a dud. For those who bought these, try double clicking the pause/play button. Mine would activate Vol+/Vol- everytime without fail. If I press pause/play too hard, the same thing would happen randomly. Definitely an internal problem.-Buttons. I wish these had the same buttons as the Liberty Neos instead of cheap feeling rectangles that stick out. Also, the button presses are annoyingly loud.-Pads. The pads on these are terrible. The best way I can describe how they feel are like the feeling of a cheap padded toilet seat that needs to be replaced. They are hot and feel mushy. Not plush like the pads on Razer headphones. Mushy like worn down bus seats.-THESE HEADPHONES SLIP. Watch the other reviewer's video where they tilt their head back and forth. I know it looks ridiculous but that's seriously what happens. I have a pretty \"normal\" sized head as a 25yo 200lb man and these slip off my head as easy as they do on my wifes head. If you quickly need to glance up, they can slip off the back of your head completely. If you need look down to tie your shoes, they'll fall towards your forehead or even cover your eyes. I adjusted them tight and loose with same results.-Noise Cancellation. Transparency and Normal sound the same. Noise Cancellation on these sound like air is being sucked out of your ears. I might just prefer Passive NC instead, but felt the need to put NC as a con.-This is just nitpicky but a new \"power on\" voice would be nice. Sounds way too robotic. Also, my headphones were shipped in a thin bag through USPS and the Q30 box came really damaged. *Good thing the headphones came inside the case.*Overall, the cons outweigh the pros and I hate the fact that they sound good with such poor build quality.

The sound quality is well above average if not excellent, the design and build are more than decent, the equalizer app makes the sound even more adjustable to your tastes, and they're pretty comfortable, more comfortable than the Q20s. But my problem is with the noise cancellation, which contrary to many reviews here, I find disqualifyingly subpar. Yes, they muffle external noise somewhat, but everything from my furnace blower to low TV sounds to noises from the apartment above me come through, especially when the music I'm playing is soft or between songs. Though I haven't been on a plane with them, I'd suspect I'd hear everything from the engine to a baby crying in the background, which to me negate the point of ANC. I realize that sound cancellation can't be perfect, but I'd expect more than what the Q30s deliver. The Q20s are much better at noise cancelling, to a level that I'd consider acceptable. The sound quality of the Q20s are slightly less than the Q30s, and the Q30s are more comfortable around the ears, but to me the difference on that score is way less than the difference in ANC quality, so I went with the 20s and saved some $$ in the process.", "helpfulvote": 72}, {"user": "AGGELHHBI3GC4ON7BJRZSZGY6BPA", "asin": "B08HMWZBXC", "rating": 1, "title": "Critical Flaw for an otherwise great product", "date": "2021-03-27", "verified": true, "content": "Soundcore q30Critical Flaw- Even after the 1.90v firmware, users that connect to 2 Bluetooth connections can have periodic painful volume increases to 100% blasting your ears out ! From researching the issue it looks like users have a variety of audio issues when connecting to 2 devices. (Note that 2 devices does NOT mean simultaneous audio from both, it's more of an easier way to swap between the 2 devices. These headphones do not support 2 simultaneously active audio sources.) Mine will randomly blast out at 100%, have periodic digital noise, and periodic digital audio lose. I don't know if this issue occurs with other similar models. This seems to occur more often when switching between the 2 devices, but also occurring randomly during use.The 100% volume glitch is unacceptable from a safety perspective and these have to be returned.I can not give more than 1 at this time for headphones that can so easily cause hearing damage.This is unfortunate because I really liked these headsets. Here are my normal pros/cons list.Pros:-Crazy long battery life, 40hrs and a quick charge 5min for 4hrs with a usb-c charger.-Soft and comfortable ear cups and headband. They are not too warm, but will heat up over time like most over ear headphones. The earcups rotate and swivel to fit most face contours and sizes. My head is average size and they work great. I think smaller sized heads even down to maybe 12yr would work, but if you have a larger head, hat, hair, etc  they might not fit well or might feel tight.-I really like the NC Noise Canceling and it is my preferred mode on these headsets for general usage. It works pretty well, of course do not expect it to block all outside sound. There is also a pass through mode that I've used on different headsets before for example in the office when you still need to be able to hear what is going on around you.-The Soundcore Android app (no separate software available for Windows) is easy to use and works well for the basic functions it performs. You will need to use the app to update the firmware and adjust the equalizers. In the app, the q30 also has additional settings for a custom equalizer, 3 NC Noise canceling mode types.-FREE carrying case, nice rigid feel with denser foam inside, the zipper pulls smoothly and appears to made to help prevent snagging on the zipper teeth.-They do not feel too large on an adult head and nicely fold up to fit in the including carrying case.-The audio and mic quality sounded really good for both music and phone call/video conferenceCons:-***The 100% volume issues at the top of the review-No Dual Audio SourceThese headphones do support 2 Bluetooth connections at the same time, but NOT like what you are probably thinking unfortunately.  2 devices does NOT mean simultaneous audio from both, it's more of an easier way to swap between the 2 devices.

I was disappointed that the only mention of this was in the FAQs because someone else had this question and had to go out of their way to find the answer. The reason for this is a firmware update that removed the noise-canceling feature when connected via AUX, they did this on purpose, not a glitch or side effect.The sound was great, the app was even better and the EQ was something that many headphones at this price range do not have. Audio works when the headphones are off/dead when connected through a wired connection, but the reason I bought noise-canceling headphones is for... the noise canceling.They are a great pair of headphones ESPECIALLY for the great price but if they do not serve the purpose of noise-canceling when wired, what's the point in paying more for the feature I am unable to use.

I Also have an XM3 and i can vouch for this headphone that it sounds the same.Build Quality---------------Its made of plastic (good quality) and the headphone has a metal band and I have a large head and it fits very well. The ear cups are also large enough to completely encapsulate my ears.The soundcore logo is prominent.No Headphone fatigue and it is not too tight and not too loose. Just Right!Charging-----------Finally, Anker came out with Type-C charger and i dont have to carry a micro-usb charger in addition to my phone charger which uses Type-C.I always make sure to charge the headphones to 100% before using, please do so.Pairing-------The headphones comes already in a pairing mode, so just turn it on and connect it to your phone or computer. The Q30 headset is capable of simultaneously connecting to two devices.Battery Life-------------Battery life is rated at 60H without noise cancelling and 40H with noise cancelling. I was not able to test the claim but it really last a long time!!Best part is 5-Min Charge = 4-Hour PlaytimePhone calls-------------I use this phone mainly for conference calls and zoom calls. Love the call quality and non one has ever complained of any issues. The 2 microphones work like a charm.Sound Quality-----------------The sound quality is outstanding, Highs, Mids, Low, all are balanced.  i had an opportunity to compare it to soundcore Q20, XM3, Sony WH-XB700., Taotronics Soundsure 85.This thing beats everything except for XM3. I can hear the minute tunes which i was not previously able to hear in WH-XB700, Soundsurge 85 or Q20.Noise cancelling has 3 modes - Indoor, Outdoor and transport. Indoor reduces chatter, outdoor reduces traffic noise and transport is for reducing plane noises.I was able to test indoor mode and works great.  True test is on a plane.Soundcore App------------------Everyone who buys this one should download the soundcore app and it lets you change from Normal to NC to Transparency (listen to conversation outside of your headphone).The soundcore app will also make sure your headphone is upto date with the software and will also let you use the equilizers.", "helpfulvote": 13}, {"user": "AGTQMKMJRL6JOFFKVI5XXDGBU6QQ", "asin": "B08HMWZBXC", "rating": 4, "title": "I can finally hear myself think (and it's terrifying)", "date": "2021-03-16", "verified": true, "content": "Preface: This is the first pair of noise-cancelling headphones I've owned, so my baseline for comparison isn't much different from sticking wads of cotton in my ears.It's been a year of this: working from home at a makeshift desk in my bedroom; kids on the other side of paper-thin walls talking loudly about school and constantly asking for snacks; the laundry machines are operating 24/7 since my mother-in-law moved in; the dog has decided that any and all movement outside my window is threat. My world is a noisy place.I needed something more substantial than the Soundcore Life U2 earbuds I've been sporting for the last year. I trust the brand, so I opted for these. They were at the top-end of my budget and seemed to have the features that I needed.First impressions:- Well-packaged! I like that it came with a carrying case (even though I am absolutely certain I will never use it because I am going to be stuck in this house until I die).- The construction feels pretty solid. No creaking of the head-band as you stretch it, so it seems unlikely to snap under stress. Nothing rattles when you handle them or wear them.- The ear cups and headband are comfortable. Not feeling like I'm going to be collecting ear-sweat in there.Turning it on and pairing it:- About as simple as pairing a Bluetooth device can be. It was pretty simple to pair it to two devices (one PC and one MacBook). There is a little bit of difficulty getting it to reconnect to one or the other after a period of disuse (also not unusual for Bluetooth)- The app (iPhone, in this case) is pretty straight-forward. It allows you to configure the noise-cancelling mode you want (eg: settings ideal for \"Transport,\" \"Indoor,\" or \"Outdoor\"). EQ settings are available as well, which, while interesting, doesn't seem to add any value for me.Noise Cancelling:Ok, seriously, this is freaky. The persistent ringing in my ears is now the loudest thing in the room. The sound of my typing has almost completely disappeared. I am getting startled by people entering my room without me hearing them. I never noticed how loud the A/C was until I couldn't hear it anymore. As I am writing this, someone is vacuuming the hallway outside my door and the only reason I know that is because the lights dimmed a little when they turned it on.Transparency mode:This is actually pretty handy. It amplifies ambient sound so it's like you're not even wearing headphones. A brief touch of the right ear (and only the right ear) will switch between normal/noise-cancelling (whichever mode you happen to be in) and transparency. My only complaint here (and it has been echoed by others), is that the announcement when you are changing modes feels... disruptive. The announcement (\"TRANSPARENCY!\") is kinda loud and lasts long enough that the time between pressing the right ear and actually changing modes is nearly three seconds (I know! Scandalous!). I find myself just pulling one of the cups off my ear if I need to hear what my wife is saying (as opposed to pretending to be busy with a call or something).Audio quality:Pretty darn good. I've blown out enough of my hearing using high-quality studio headphones in my distant I-was-in-a-band past that I'm not a complete snob about it anymore. But these are solid.Mic quality:Here's the thing you should know about Bluetooth - it's actually not that great for quality 2-way audio. You know that coworker with the plug-in gamer headset that you can tell what flavor of Doritos he's eating? This isn't that. Still, the mic quality is good when connected to my MacBook - my coworkers report that I do not sound like I am talking to them via speakerphone in a submarine (I'm looking at you, AirPods...)They do, however, report that it picks up a lot of the noise around me. Independent tests confirm that pretty much anything the noise-cancelling counteracts is picked up on the mic. As a result I generally have to remain on mute unless I am actively speaking (not ideal in one-on-one calls).Verdict: I'm quite happy with the headphones, though I can't really recommend these for calls. For this reason alone, I am deducting a star.Overall: My introduction into the world of noise-cancelling headphones has been enlightening. I have realized that the trouble I have focusing on my tasks has little to do with my noisy environment, but is rather a result of the terrifying noises going on in my own head.", "helpfulvote": 10}, {"user": "AHVTRK4DLGJQJJDTKIGQN5GQNDWA", "asin": "B08HMWZBXC", "rating": 5, "title": "\u201cWife-conversation proof\u201d", "date": "2020-11-09", "verified": true, "content": "I purchased these headphones based on a product recommendation from a YouTuber.To start with, they are packaged very well.

My wife says to mention that the headphones, when ANC is on, are wife-conversation proof. And they do significantly limit the volume of conversations around. Transparency mode is also nice and easily activated by laying a palm on the right ear cup for two seconds.Battery capacity appears to be excellent so far, but I\u2019ve not fully depleted them.The button configuration, primarily on the right ear cup, takes a little getting used to and isn\u2019t super intuitive, but it\u2019s easy to learn with a day of practice.", "helpfulvote": 13}, {"user": "AHSUB4E3HK53AHQ2BJRIAJOBUSKQ", "asin": "B08HMWZBXC", "rating": 1, "title": "Microphones don't work to take phone calls or conference calls.", "date": "2020-11-29", "verified": true, "content": "Love the sound.

Come on. These guys are doing stuff at this price point that amaze me. I use my headphones (in priority) as follows 1. Zoom 2. Music 3. Transparency1. Zoom calls can be sneaky test for headphones. Not only do you need a good chipset and well designed firmware to work with a plethora of laptops, mobile devices etc but you also need microphones that work. This headset amazed me. I thought if I could get half the performance of higher end units I would say it\u2019s fine. I was wrong. People tell me I sound natural and clear. Transparency works well. Connectivity is solid. No issues on M1 MBP.2. Music. Come on Soundcore. What are you hiding in these? Bass. Mids. Highs. All come in perfectly. I really think there is more behind the scenes going on for these to sound this good. Compared to XM4s these have more bass (controlled) and not muddy. The mids are solid not over done and the highs are crisp and clear. I don\u2019t run my units at 100% volume so I can\u2019t comment about that but at medium volume these blow my mind. I returned every headset I have and kept these.3. Transparency and ANC - solid and works well. I think some more tuning in firmware will improve ANC. When I have it on I don\u2019t hear my kids. So it works. What else can you ask for? It\u2019s the ultimate test. :)Overall - these are scary good. I have the blacks but once the blue are in stock will pick up a pair of them too. Just amazing.

Update: worse after firmware update", "date": "2021-03-23", "verified": true, "content": "Q30's are a mixed bag when comparing to Q20's. I would not at all say it's an improvement.First of all, I bought Q20's exclusively for noisy environments, like driving a very noisy vehicle with a slightly cracked window, airplanes landing and taking off, noisy neighborhood backyards, etc (8-10hrs at a time).  I wanted noise cancellation without even using them for music, which is great with Soundcore's, because they remain on without shutting off.Q20's made an annoying, loud, almost painful crackle-pop noises when a vehicle's window is open too much, but it's fine when cracked just a little. Q30's don't have the crackle-pop, but they're constantly making thundering noise, sounds like wind buffeting, even with no window closer\u2014this aggravating noise is headache-inducing. Ready to throw out Q30's just for that.  This makes music music now sound distorted in noisy environments.Q20's had a normal mode and bass boost mode, which was simple and effective\u2014you could have the music barely audible with bass boost mode and it was absolutely perfect. With Q30's, there's too much bass\u2014music sounds like junk now.Q30's have the app to customize the EQ which is great **for those who have time to screw around with that nonsense.**  Q20's sounded fine as-is, with bass boost toggle, even if the ran out of steam with ANC enabled at higher volumes, causing the volume to fluctuate with low tones.My Q20's broke at one hinge after falling just 1.5-2 feet onto a semi-soft surface\u2014never abused.  Q30's appear to have hinges with potentially less stress on them when dropped or otherwise mishandled.Q30's clamp slightly tighter around the head than Q20's, which makes Q30's them less comfortable in my opinion and experience.Q30's will perform better than Q20's in typical indoor environments, but in harsher environments, in my experience of months with Q20's snd just three days with Q30's, they're worse.Passive mode?  EQ adjustments in app?  500000 hours of battery life?  Those are junk features meant to compete with other products out there.  No use for them at all.I'm especially aggravated with the thundering noise from the wind.  Only good things are better hinges, USB- C and carrying case.Anker needs to split the Life Q 20's and 30's into their own paths, I think.  Maybe $300+ premium brand headphones are actually worth that money.Update: July 2021Worse Bluetooth connectivity after firmware update.After firmware and app update, the volume is now zero after connecting (no matter where you left it) or too loud.Something is way off and they wrecked it.

To put it simply, these are amazing and hold their own against some of the best out there.  Used on the S10 Plus, here is what I\u2019ve noticed this far:Pairing \u2013 Easy and simple. When you turn on Bluetooth, you will see the device name \u201cSoundcore 2\u201d and \u201cSound core 2 L\u201d.  Essentially, each earbud outputs a signal and when you connect to one, it automatically syncs with the other earbud. When connected, you will be greeted with a voice stating the battery is high.  Also, when paring and connected, each earbud outputs a blinking white light, letting you know they are ready to pair and connected.Battery \u2013 Long lasting! I own both the Airpod pro and Powerbeats pro, and the Soundcore 2 is a battery champ. It is rated for 7 hours and while I have never fully depleted them, I can confirm they outlast the Airpod Pro\u2019s by a long mile and from 7AM to 1PM, the battery regularly has 70%left; volume between 30-50%. I am confident that these can make it through an 8-hour day, with no issue.  The charging case does not display the battery percentage for itself, however the phone Bluetooth settings on your phone does show how much the earbuds have.Sound \u2013 Excellent.  These are very, very good for both phone calls, music, and video.  Whether in traffic, downtown city, or outside, parties on the other end of the call never have issue hearing me, nor me hearing the other side. Music and video sounds just as good, coming off very clear and crisp, with no lag or delay. Let me reiterate, I confirm there is no lag whatsoever, so do not let that hold you back.Fit \u2013 Very comfortable.  The Soundcore 2 earbuds plug right into the ear, with no issue and comes with 5 sizes for ear tips.  If there was anything I do not like, its that the earbuds create pressure when pushed in too far or when using the control button and this is uncomfortable.  Also, there is a level of noise cancellation, as certain elements of the outside are blocked, however the Soundcore 2 does not have official active noise cancellation (ANC).Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would buy again or for a close one.Update 07/05/2020: now using with a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, and these work with no problems!Update 03/25/2021: these earbuds are still going strong, no issues still.Important update 04/30/2021: I accidentally left these earbuds in my pockets, no realizing until afterwards, and put them through a full wash and drying cycle.

Take the bad reviews with grain of salt, give these a try.", "date": "2019-11-04", "verified": true, "content": "I bought two sets of these when they launched, before all the reviews were posted.  My order was shipped to my mail forwarding address, and I finally received them today at my overseas DPO address, but I was a bit concerned for the last 3 weeks because of the falling average reviews.However, now I see that the low average might be the result of Anker actually being honest and not buying reviews, perhaps, or inflating them at the beginning to gather more sales.  Looks like Anker did this honestly by selling the device at a discount at launch, which I applaud.  Kudos, Anker.I'm not an audiophile, but an audio enthusiast.  I can compare these to my Sennheiser PXC 550, and my wife's Sony WH1000XM2, both first tier wireless, over-ear noise cancelling headphones.  I also currently own or owned a Sennheiser HD598, HD6xx, and Hifiman HD-4xx, powered by a dedicated USB DAC/AMP.  And I use an LG G7 because it has a Quad-DAC to use with wired headphones, and although it doesn't matter here I wanted to let you know where I'm coming from.Before I get to the product review, just to be clear I'm not a die hard Anker fan.  It's been mostly positive, but I've had a couple of Anker products die just outside of the warranty period so I've never been hesitant to try other brands.With that said, first off, the complaint about lack of bass is COMPLETELY unjustified.  Using a bass frequency test, I found the bass didn't roll off until 32hz and it extends down to 25hz at a usable dB.  Either other reviewers had really bad source materials or they didn't use the right size ear piece, or they had a faulty unit.  It's actually too much bass for EDM, so I had to EQ it down quite a bit.  One reviewer mentioned a V-shape curve, and although I didn't notice any over emphasized high frequencies, I have a feeling they tuned these for mass market appeal.  You'll have to play with the EQ a bit to find the sound that you like.To me, the sound is acceptable.  And for $45 I paid for these, that is a HUGE compliment.  Why? Because looking at my Amazon purchase history, I've gone through no less than 4 different cable linked bluetooth earphones ranging from $20-$40, and they were all HORRIBLE.  For a truly wireless earphones at this price range, the sound quality was a very pleasant surprise.  They have different characteristics, but I would say they're comparable to the wired Sennheiser CX300 and better than the AKG tuned Samsung earbuds, but with too much bass.  However, these Anker earphones are FAR more comfortable than both of the wired ones I own.Also, the build quality far exceeds other earphones at this price range.  They feel premium, with a soft texture, even on the case.  The case is small, well made, and charges via USB-C.  Earphones fit well, and don't shift in my ear when I turn my head as the cable linked bluetooth earphones do.  And unlike one reviewer's complaint, the earphones can get VERY loud, and with the right fit and no sound leakage, you're just asking for ear damage at high volumes.I chose this model because 1. these were just released with the newest tech, such as aptX, 2. active noise cancelling, 3. longer battery life from the stem design, and 4. IPx7.  These will be my everyday earphones for commute, with the bigger headphones reserved for long flights.TLDR:  I have some experience with audio.  I bought two sets, for me and my wife, and we both love them.  Take the bad reviews with a grain of salt - these earphones are comfortable, have a lot of bass (too much without EQ), sound quality is acceptable at this price point (a compliment), and the build quality is excellent. These are definitely worth the $60 normal price, though I feel fortunate to have picked them up with the launch discount.If my experience changes after using them for a while, I'll come back and edit the review.", "helpfulvote": 270}, {"user": "AGJKINUYGQCCLAMYRRUCSFW6CIHQ", "asin": "B07SJR6HL3", "rating": 5, "title": "Great inexpensive true wireless headphones!", "date": "2019-10-06", "verified": true, "content": "As a Google Pixel owner I have been looking for an Airpods competitor that would allow me to have true wireless headphones that can charge over USB-C, have a rock solid connection, good audio quality, and good call quality.

Based off of other reviews, I think I just got a bad set of the Ankers. Bottom line: I was disappointed in these, compared to my other two sets of earbuds. There are better \"true wireless\" earbuds out there, even for the price.Below is a review based on the three sets earbuds that I have (or have tried for extended periods). The three sets include: these Aukey earbuds, Anker's Soundcore Life P2, and Sony's WF-1000XM3. Of the three, Aukey is by far the easiest to carry around, due to the case size, and is far cheaper than the rest. I use the my Aukey's for my work-phone calls, and while doing messy projects, while my Sony's for relaxing and listening to high quality music, and for personal phone calls. I used to use the Ankers for work phone calls, until I returned them. I tried not to let the probable defects interfere with my judgement... to a point.Price:  1. Aukey ($25); 2. Anker ($50); 3. Sony ($225)... Big difference between Sony and the competition. Aukey is 1/2 the price of Anker, and 1/9th the price of Sony.Sound:  1. Sony; 2a. Aukey; 2b. Anker... Sony is the clear winner, but for the price, it better be. Sony's pack an incredible sound in such a small device. Anker and Aukey have very similar sound, but the Anker set I had a little bit of a static issue when my phone got close within a few feet from the earbuds.Case Size:  1. Aukey; 2. Anker; 3. Sony. See pics. Substantial difference between these three. Aukey is by far the smallest case, and so much easier to carry around in your pocket. Sony on the other hand is nearly too big to carry around.Battery:  1. Anker (7 hrs - case 40 hrs); 2. Sony (6 hrs - case 32 hrs); 3. Aukey (5 hrs case - 25 hrs). This makes sense based off of build and case size (see above).Physical Build:  1. Sony; 2. Anker; 3. Aukey. Sony's feel really well made, while Aukey feels really light and cheap. Anker is somewhere in between. Don't let the light and cheap feel of Aukey fool you though!Noise Cancellation:  1. Sony (active); 2a. Aukey (passive); 2b. Anker (passive). All do a surprisingly good job at noise cancellation (NC); though Sony, with active NC, is the clear winner.Microphone: 1a. Aukey; 1b. Sony; 3. Anker. I got lot of complaints with the Anker set. Anker is supposed to have really good microphones though, so I'm thinking I might've just got a bad set.If you found this review helpful, please like it, so other people can find it easier.", "helpfulvote": 142}, {"user": "AEMIIPWD3X3K44TYEDV6OC5WFSBA", "asin": "B07SJR6HL3", "rating": 1, "title": "Worst buds ever", "date": "2019-12-31", "verified": true, "content": "What started as a promising pair of wireless ear buds turned to a big mistake.I first received it and loved it.

Although the outcome did not solve the issues I had, I still have a great set of audio-only ear buds.  Anker reached out directly to me and offered many ways to resolve my problems with video lipsync. You can sleep soundly buying anything from Anker because they want you to be happy, their customer service via email is incredibly responsive and they make sure you are taken care of, leading up to a return with refund if it really came to that.As for my issues, I'm using a Google Pixel 1 XL which does not have bluetooth 5.0 from what I can tell. So it is possible that is why the lipsync is so bad. I just don't know. They didn't make any attempts to blame my equipment in any way, and I'm just guessing. I also discovered that the phone quality is pretty bad but I don't talk on the phone very much to begin with so it doesn't matter.Bottom line: These are great audio-only ear buds for the price. If you are just doing music or podcasts, they have my recommendation.  And Anker one of the best companies I have interacted with in a long time.  Thanks for the Customer Service!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm always looking to Anker when shopping for my next electronics purchase. I'm definitely a fan of them, and really wanted to love these headphones, but it's almost useless for any sort of video use.My first experience was doing podcasts as I walk to work, so I can enjoy tangle free listening, finally!  I thought they just sound ok but then tried music. I was pleasantly surprised.  Music was great. I started off with bassy stuff, and it has plenty of kick for me when they are properly seated to be airtight. A loose fit makes you loose all the bass.Lastly, I tried video.  YouTube and Netflix. Both have a significant lipsync delay and kills it for me. I asked my coworker to check his Airpods for this delay and there was none.I guess that's just a sacrifice you make with the processing speed in the buds. They need to take that digital signal over Bluetooth, convert to analog and then amplify. More money buys you faster processing speed? Maybe?I got a good deal on these. And for just audio, I highly recommend them for the $50 price point. But if you want to be able to also enjoy any video, it might cost more than this.", "helpfulvote": 20}, {"user": "AGYQX3RCKTXKZP4YW7J7QG4TNETQ", "asin": "B07SJR6HL3", "rating": 5, "title": "Fantastic wireless earbuds for the price, and they rival the Liberty Air 2", "date": "2019-10-29", "verified": true, "content": "I've had these for about a week now. Audio quality is very good, though I feel that some of Anker's \"traditional\" bluetooth earbuds (like the Slim+) sound more dynamic. By dynamic, I mean better separation between instruments, and just closer to using a nice pair of wired earbuds. Overall though, FANTASTIC for $60. Additionally, you can use each earbud independently, and Bluetooth 5.0 ensures there's never any cutting out or skipping. Calls also come in through both earbuds instead of just one (this was an issue with early truly wireless earbuds). I feel like these absolutely nail the basics (USB-C, AptX high quality audio, solid battery life, small case).The battery seems like it could go on forever; I've yet to reach low battery, and the case providing an additional 40 hours (!!!) is amazing. I think these are the first pair of earbuds that I can consider full-time replacements to my wired earbuds (I have a Galaxy Note 9, which means I can use wired headphones too).The only pair of wireless earbuds I'd consider over these are the Liberty Air 2 (also from Anker), and that's because they have:- Wireless charging case- Sensors for auto-pausing the music when you pull out an earbud- Touch controls instead of physical buttons that you press and jam the buds into your ear a bit (and also allow for things like volume control and stuff)- HearID, which automatically tunes the earbuds to your ears (though some phones like Samsung's have this feature built into the phone anyway)However, I got the P2's on sale for $45, and even at the full price of $60, they're half the price of the Liberty Air 2's. For that price difference, I can absolutely forgive the shortcomings. Especially when you factor in some benefits of the P2's over the Air 2's, like 40 Hours of battery life (P2) vs 28 Hours (Air 2).I would say that, between the P2's and Liberty Air 2's, the notable differences are price and better battery life (P2) vs noise cancellation, wireless charging case, and touch controls.

But $26 is also wasted for the person whose A51 5G UW I purchased it for :/UPDATE 13 APR 21:Returned the old one for a replacement, just to give Anker the benefit of the doubt on a faulty unit, since I like the company's other products. 2nd one arrived in the mail two days late today, more than a week after starting the return process w/ UPS Store...New one also does nothing when plugged into known good power supply, USB-C cable, and wall outlet. New also charges my old Note 8 just fine, behaving identically to the first unit -- so at least that one wasn't faulty -- both behave this way by design.Sorry Anker -- gave you two chances, but now have to insist your 40W 2-port USB-C charger, does not charge the Samsung A51 5G UW, not even a little bit -- and to please remove that claim from your ad here on Amazon :/UPDATE 27 JUN 21:Also found the replacement intermittently doesn't charge my USB-C wireless earbuds as well (Tronsmart Apollo Bolds -- another Amazon product that ends up disappointing).

This is definitely impressive customer service, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the product is bad. I suppose it may be true what one reviewer stated that this is the best choice of a lightning cable because you can get it replaced if/when it stops working.

If so, I may decide to upgrade my review again (to 4 stars), but then again, my review should probably be strictly about the product purchased.Original review:Don\u2019t let the hype fool you. These are no better than pretty much any other lightning cable I have found. It in fact may be worse than average. As far as my experience goes, they pretty much all stop working consistently after a time. After being asked to search for a non-existent serial number, I did get a replacement once. This tactic was clearly used as a means of reducing the number of warranty claims. I was persistent and didn\u2019t give up, however. But who wants to repeat that exercise over and over?

I bought these based on trust of the Anker brand and overall good reviews. I am struggling between a review of 3 or 4 stars.If I was just rating based on sound quality, comfort and battery life, they would be 5 stars no doubt. They sound great, they fit in my ears very nicely (they come with the largest selection of ear tips and wings that I've ever seen). They are comfortable under a stocking cap and since they have an actual button and not a touch sensor, I can activate them with gloves on. Phone calls are excellent too, even while riding my bicycle, the caller and I can hear clearly with no wind noise which has been a problem in the past with other earbuds I have used.My biggest complaint is the control scheme. It's really bad, I'm not sure what the designer was thinking here. Since raising and lowering the volume (which I do rarely) uses a single button press on both ear buds, pausing requires a double-click. To skip forward a track, you double-click the LEFT earbud, which is totally counter-intuitive. There is no way to skip backwards. Voice assistant is a long press on either earbud and equalizer cycle through is triple-click on either. I am sure I would get used to it eventually if it were the only pair I used, but it's not, so I am constantly changing the volume when trying to pause or skipping forward when trying to skip backward.If the control scheme doesn't concern you, this is a five-star pair of TWS earbuds that I whole-heartedly recommend. If you're like me though and don't think you would like the control scheme, you may want to pass on these. If they weren't so excellent otherwise, I would return them based on that.Update 7/2/21: was teetering between 3 and 4 stars, I originally gave 3 stars because I really didn't like the control scheme. I still don't like the controls but adding the fourth star because Anker reached out to me to offer me a refund.

Bottom line, this is a good company, not a no-name knockoff, and it shows.I first bought a less expensive no-name pair that fit my need for running, biking, etc and the reviews were good, with respect to sound as well which is important to me.  I don't want to generalize and I'm no audiophile but the sound in the less expensive buds was tolerable but not good at all.  They produced noise like a low end car stereo (which many people are ok with).  They were consistent with the less expensive ones my kids and wife have who are ok with hearing noise rather than music.  They also paired the left one as a slave to the right and I couldn't get it connected right.  I'm a tech guy and I think it was faulty so I returned.  I wanted something better.Many may be ok with a less expensive pair if you get a working pair but for the 20 bucks extra, these things sound fantastic comparatively and well worth it.  Again, no audiophile here but for perspective I run some pretty high end equipment in my home and car.  I was really shocked at what these produced.  Maybe you can get better sound by spending even more but to me it might be negligibly better, might just get other features.  I see no reason for my needs.Pairing was much easier too, I've used one earbud, right or left, depending if I'm running or biking with zero issues.  I haven't memorized the controls yet but I think you do lose some control just using one which seems obvious but I'll mention it.  That said, while biking I took calls with one bud in and the other person could hear me fine.  They said I sounded a little distant but I also had a thin hat on a gator over my mouth and ears so I was impressed they even heard me.I have had no issues with them coming loose running, biking, circuit training, etc.  They are packaged well with multiple choices to fit.  Wings or no wings, multiple sizes, etc.I thought about the waterproofing but after researching, if Bluetooth doesn't work under water like for swimming, waterproofing became less important to me.

If you're wearing the left earbud by itself, the only way to pause music is on your phone. And having to double tap the button to pause on the right earbud is super annoying. Please look at the controls in the description before buying these, as that may be a deal breaker for you. Had I noticed that before buying these, I would have chose something else. Luckily the sound quality is so amazing, that I'm probably just gonna suffer through the stupid button controls. Also, these have 3 EQ options, by pressing the button 3 times in quick succession on either ear bud. The only problem is that there is absolutely no feedback to let you know which mode you're in.

We actually lost a tv a couple of weeks ago, unfortunately. Anyways was looking for something that provided decent protection, numerous ports so I could cut down on daisy chains from previous setups, and some kind of equipment protection.The first point was that I had issues with the seller, I'm not sure what happened but I thought I was getting these from Anker but instead came from Woot. My shipping date was pushed back, and also then delayed in route somewhere. Upon arrival the outside box was beaten up; the strips all came in individual boxing which all looked okay.Pros: These guys have a nice heft to them and it feels well built to me. I ordered 5; took them all out individually plugged them in and checked every port on each. There's no crazy barrier-type sensation in the ports that I've noticed with other powerstrips. You have 4 light indicators for: (White: Powered on, Blue: Grounded, and Surge Protection x2). Everything was well. Installed one in my room, living room, and 2 in our office (had like 16-17 plugs with like 4-5 old strips covered by 2 of these bad boys). For the most part, large or small plugs didn't clash and take up ports.Cons: The mounting was a pain; we looked through several of our screws and mounting options the holes aren't anything we're typically used to? I ended up saying forget screw mounting and purchased adhesive command strips stuck two of them on and pressed them on walls under the counters.I had an issue with one power strip. When I tested them all out at first everything was good. Once I had them setup, one strip once plugged in and had at least one device attached, would show an indicator light for \"Grounded protection\" even if the strip was powered on or off. Contacted Amazon they couldn't get out an exchange and I really needed these. I've spent the last several days communicating with Anker and besides the delay that occurs from emailing... they've been great. I sent some pictures of the model, then a video showing how the indicator would remain on regardless of the strip switched on and off. Also learned the switching it off and on could could fix the issue, but for me the indicator would go off, but in about 20 seconds it would slowly come back on even in the off position. They wanted me to send the product for their engineers to check and send a replacement, but some return issue happened and they are just sending me a replacement.TL;DR: Bought several. Shipping + delivery could have been better. Strips feel well built so many ports!! Mounting sucked for me got adhesive strips instead. Had an issue with one strip being faulty, contacted Anker they provided support and replacement is en route. Did have a storm the day after I set some up my devices seem ok.

There are several main issues right out of the box that make the item deserve to be returned:(1) There are no 3rd party certification markings or stickers such as \"UL\", or any other agencies that certify the safety of electrical items on the box or on the powers strip itself - this is a major concern!  There is also something loose rattling around in one of the two strips we purchased.(2) The screw holes for wall mounting the power strip are not only made so poorly that no screws will slide into the recess or hold the strip on any vertical surface.  The mounting holes on the two strips I purchased are also oriented opposite to the images shown by the vendor.  The cord exits the top of the strip on both power strips I purchased.  This means a large snake of a cord has to run up the wall a short distance before curving down to the floor.  Tge weight if the cord also pulls the power strip off of any method of securing it..big mistake Forget!  Tgere is a reason why every other power strip has the cord running in opposition to the screw mounts!  Forget trying to make the cord less visible; but it won't stay on the wall because of the faulty screw mounting holes anyway, so it's a total waste of my money for the application I needed the power strips for, and where I needed to mount them.Images from the Amazon listing and other purchasers show their items had the cords exiting the other end of the power strip, with the screw mounting holes oriented correctly, even if made poorly; so perhaps I recieved a cheap knock off, which concerns me even more!!!Due to other activities we were involved in when these arrived, we are just now trying to install the power strips, so the return time has expired.  I foolishly only opened the boxes and made a brief cursory exam of the power strips. I had no idea a closer look would reveal totally questionable products!  We have bought numerous Anker items over the years, and have never been disappointed, until now.  They blew it with these power strips!!!

On the latter, these power strips deliver.  I was able to plug everything into the same power strip, even when the larger power pack plugs found on some of my devices.  While I have not opened the other Anker surge protectors with the USB ports, I can only hope they are more sturdy than these.  Aside from the fact that I received two obviously previously used and returned power strips, which is not really Anker's fault, I'm just not thrilled with the feel of these power strips.  The \"fire resistant exterior\" appears to be plastic and stamped sheet metal (nothing wrong with either).  However, the piece as a whole feels cheap.  It kind of rattles when you pick it up and sounds hollow and tinny when you tap on it.  Of course there aren\u2019t, but it sounds like there are cheap springs vibrating inside whenever you move it.  Finally, every single item I plugged into it sparked just a little when I plugged it in.  It wasn't dangerous, but just seems almost like the insides are a little loose and just \"gave\" a little when I inserted plugs, creating a little arc.  It's not bad enough to return, but I can't say I got the peace of mind I'd hoped for when I decided to undertake cleaning up the birds nest of wires I had in my office and audio/video cabinets.  For whatever this is worth, I didn't experience the same frustration from reviewers who said they were confounded by the orientation of the mounting holes: I understand their point, but can't envision many cases where you couldn't or wouldn't just mount it horizontally or on the underside of a surface, so I wouldn't let that affect your purchase unless you have a use case where it absolutely has to be mounted vertically and your outlet is below your mounting point (in the case of higher outlets, such as in a workshop where the power strip would be mounted below the outlet, the mounting holes would be oriented correctly for a vertical install): you won't please everyone on this point.  Overall, it's just not the \"solid\" product I'm used to expecting from Anker (their USB C and lightning cables are second-to-none).  I can't say I'm as happy with the outcome as I anticipated, as some part of me feels like these are a little lower quality than I anticipated, and I don't feel like they are more safe than the cluster of cables and wires I was dealing with before.", "helpfulvote": 1}, {"user": "AGS3AYRX3H7XLEYMAPE3GL477VCQ", "asin": "B091CWJX78", "rating": 5, "title": "Above any expectations", "date": "2020-09-06", "verified": true, "content": "The plug options are far better than most, they are snug, allow for larger connectors.

Finally, 4K60 over just USB-C with other ports (including making up to 10Gbps available to them) for a reasonable price. Unfortunately, the first two things I've done with it were both disappointing. I'll cut to the chase, the power delivery pass through isn't working with one of their own chargers.The first device I tried connecting this with is my Anker PD4 with one USB-C cable as the only thing plugged into it so I can test the truly up to 100W (-15 for its own power) claims. I've tried connecting it with Apple's 2m USB-C charge cable (100w capable) and an equivalent CableMatters cable that also supports 100W. When plugged directly into my laptop, both of these cables immediately start charging it and show up as 100W power sources. When this Anker hub is plugged in and either of them is connected to the power delivery port on the side of it, the laptop does not charge (laptop is a 16\" Macbook Pro, I've tried multiple ports just for the heck of it).My second complaint is that when absolutely nothing is plugged into it, it becomes fairly warm to the touch. Why, when it's doing nothing, is it hot? I'm clearly not running data or even power through it so I have low hopes for it under load.The fact that it doesn't work in exactly the scenario they want it to most (a MacBook Pro with one of their own chargers) seems like a pretty big fail. I've got lots of USB-C things though so I thought I'd grab a couple and try those. Using an Apple 96W USB-C charger, the device does pass through power delivery properly. It shows up as providing 79W to the laptop (siphoning off 17W in this instance). I also have a 56W Aukey charger that splits power between a USB-A port and a USB-C port that can provide 45W of power delivery. When plugged into that charger it does appear to work as well and appears in macOS as a 30W power source.Maybe the problem is the Anker PD4? But it works fine providing power to the laptop directly. Would love to hear from Anker about these two products working together and what I should actually expect. Having it be unreliable for power delivery isn't great, but power and heat aside (it is getting a little bit warmer now that it's providing power from the Apple power adapter, but still definitely holdable), the hardware looks and feels good and the cable feels durable. Worth also noting that there's a white LED ring on the side of it that appears to be always on when it's plugged in. Don't know why it needs an LED.-----Update, June 22, 2020:I've done some more testing and Anker has reached out to me to investigate what might be the issue. I can say that the hub works as I would expect from a quick test with my iPad Pro 11\" with the above functioning chargers. It was able to pass through power with the 96W Apple Charger on the other end to both the iPad port as well as a Magic Keyboard port. The ethernet adapter showed up in iOS settings and an external drive was functional. When connected via the Magic Keyboard, which is a power only connection, as expected it provided only power.Still no power passthrough of any kind when connected to the PD4.-----Update July 1, 2020:I've written back and forth with Anker and they've sent me a replacement hub. It also doesn't work with the PD4. I've tried multiple USB-C cables but they have also shipped a cable to test with it. For now I'm increasing the review from 2 to 3 stars because I am more and more suspicious about the PD4 and less about this hub. They claim that they have tested the setup I have separately without issue, and I've sent video showing the problems I've encountered, so the troubleshooting is ongoing.Have had a chance to use Ethernet on it without issue. Still need to try to test out its throughput when trying to use a 10Gbps USB-C enclosure and a 4K60 monitor at the same time (+ ethernet).More updates to come.-----Update July 10, 2020:I've continued to talk with Anker support and they shipped me a replacement PD4. The one I had was labeled as \"Iteration 1\" on its barcode, the one I got back was labeled \"Iteration 2\". I tested it out and it works perfectly with this hub, passing through the correct amount of power to multiple Macbook Pros and fast charging an iPad Pro. Clearly the fault doesn't lie with this hub and is instead an issue with the first iteration PD4, so I'm updating my review accordingly. Working with Anker support was great.I've also been able to test USB-C throughput (without driving a display as well so far) and it properly utilizes 10Gbps.

So you can charge and use another USB-C device at the same time.I am using a USB-C webcam with my laptop and with remote work I'm in meetings much more frequently than before. My laptop has only one USB-C port, so I was always switching back to charging after meetings and then back to webcam before my meeting. This became annoying, but my webcam draws enough power that my battery can only sustain ~3 hours of continuous meetings without charge. Due to days where I am in meetings all day long, I was going without webcam on later calls so I could keep my laptop battery charged (via the single USB-C port).Enter this product. My salvation? Unfortunately not.While the device does allow you to pass power through the PD USB-C port and have a second USB-C device connected, the data transfer through the second port is not reliable or stable. Within minutes my webcam picture would glitch (think old-school TV with a bad signal) intermittently. After about 5 minutes the webcam video would freeze completely and the hub would lower power and then reconnect.I thought maybe it was my laptop charger. It's only 65W and the hub uses 15W of that so I worried maybe there wasn't enough power for both my laptop to charge, the hub's 15W use, AND my webcam. So I instead used my 100W charger.

I've learned a few things: A port that looks like USB-C does not pass video unless it is a \"Thunderbolt\" port (look for the lightning bolt logo, apparently); connecting a USB-C-to-mini-DisplayPort adapter to the USB-C port on this hub did not allow my monitor to work. Lesson learned. The HDMI port did work, and did pass 4K@60Hz, but only after I adjusted my monitor settings. At first I was convinced either my HDMI cable or this hub were defective, because macOS would only allow me to select 4K@30Hz. I have an LG 4K display, and from reading forums, one must enable 60Hz in the on-screen display menu before the monitor will tell the computer it is capable of displaying 60Hz video. For my monitor, that meant changing \"Ratio\" in \"Quick Settings\" to \"Original\" (it defaulted to \"Wide\", with a separate configuration for each port), as well as turning on \"HDMI ULTRA HD Deep Color\" from \"Picture\" -> \"Picture Adjust.\" After I changed those two settings, 60Hz was not available until I unplugged the HDMI cable from the hub and plugged it in again. After that I had buttery smooth 4K video at 60Hz. The hub works as advertised, at least for my configuration. The 1GigE port works well, and is equivalent to a direct USB-C to Ethernet adapter I tried. It does run warm to the touch as other reviewers have reported. That's not problematic, but I'd prefer it pass the missing 17W to the laptop rather than dissipate it as heat. Time will tell how well the hub holds up, but for now I'm happy.

I have a degree in electronic components, so I was not exactly alarmed by the temperature (the rule of thumb is that it's still OK if you can touch it) but I was definitely thinking that one component or another will fail pretty soon.So - I called the Anker US support number. First thing: a real person (Malcolm) answered right away.Stating upfront that at all times Anker will back me up with a replacement no questions asked, he registered my claim, gave me a ticket number back, yet he suggested that I should maybe try first to swap the components between the computers and see if the problem is indeed with the hub and/or the charger or not. Which I did. Both the chargers and the hubs were OK. A problem with the backup drive (later determined to be caused by a low quality connection cable Seagate provided with their external HDD) was causing Time Machine to perpetually and unsuccessfully attempting to write backups to the disk.

Both setups draw now about 3-4 Watts (and are essentially cold) when the Macs are sleeping and 25-40W (and are barely warm) in operation.

One quirk I don't understand is that I plugged the PD port into my power cube, and the iPad told me it wasn't charging. That isn't good. I might have to return it and shop for a different brand. The newer Apple devices are awfully picky as to where they get their power from.Update: I found the email for Anker customer support, sent an email, and they got right back to me. Here is what they said:\"Please first know: Due to the power input limitations of mobile devices, this hub can not provide pass-through charging to tablets (including iPad Pro/Air) or phones when using the original wall charger that came with your mobile device. To support full-speed charging for iPad Pro/Air, use an adapter that supports at least 15V (45W).\"I found that the 3 foot power cord that Apple sent me is nowhere near long enough for charging while using the dock, so I sent away for a 45W charger and a 10 foot USB-C to USB-C charging cable that was compatible with iPad. Please be aware that Apple has circuitry embedded in the cord and you cannot use just any cord. The equipment I got was this:Charger  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B083BRKMJQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Cord  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LF1FNRV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Cords are not rated in either volts or watts, so I sent another email to Anker asking if a 3 amp cable would work, and they told me that it should. Pay attention to the amperage when purchasing a cable to go with a high wattage charger.The cord that I purchased also comes in a 15 foot length. If this rig works, I will also purchase the 15 foot cord. The reason being that sometimes I need to do stuff in other people's houses, and I cannot count on a nearby outlet.I will update when the new equipment comes.Update: I installed a 45W charger with a USB-C TO USB-C cable that was advertised for iPads, and now my iPad is charging through the PD port, so that problem is taken care of.I sold the iPad and bought a 2019 MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has four Type C USB ports only, no others. I use one of the ports on the Mac for charging and another for the hub. I use the Type 3 USB ports on the hub for my mouse and graphic tablet. I like wired mice, because they use a wire for power, are more reliable, and do not generate dead batteries to pollute the environment. I wish the hub had an additional Type 2 or 3 USB port. Maybe I will buy an additional adapter, because I can't find a hub that sports the extra ports. I looked for a mouse that would plug into a USB C port, but did not find one to my taste. I like wired keyboards for the same reason I like wired mice.At any rate, all these wires that will not plug directly into my computer makes kind of a clutter, as depicted in my photo.

I saw this coming and purchased some Anker adapters to go with it.Additionally, I know how electricity works. Thus, had I decided not to purchase the adapters, I can find a source which can deliver the appropriate load. Unfortunately, the average customer will not do this. They will likely purchase the device, then find any USB port to attach it to (even if the port is designed for data only). Then, when their phone or other wireless device fails to charge properly, they tend complain. Keep in mind that the average customer will not put up with much frustration when troubleshooting. After a while they will determine that it's not worth the hassle (even IF they contact customer support). Much of the risk of customer dissatisfaction can be reduced simply by including the aforementioned adapter.For this particular product, I gave a 4 out of 5 stars for traveling. This only due to the shape. However, there are similar products designed for easier travel. I intentionally went for this design because I planned on using it at home on my nightstand and at work near my monitor.

Microsun lamps use a patented \"daylight\" bulb and are a little sensitive to current fluctuations, so it didn't surprise me too much that thereafter, for two years, my three Microsun lamps flickered randomly with no discernible pattern; I just chalked it up to my own lousy repair skills! However, yesterday I was presented with an opportunity to verify said hypothesis: I wanted to flip my new king size mattress after six months of ownership and had to tear down my entire bedroom in order to do so (that thing is big and heavy and would only behave when cinched up with four Stanley ratchet straps). When I put everything back together, I decided to plug both my of bedroom Microsun lamps into the wall instead of the two Anker power strips. No more flicker. In my office this morning, I decided to swap out the third Anker for a Belkin power strip at the exact same wattage and amperage power ratings, a sturdy metal unit built in the early 1980s that has a much longer cord. Likewise, no more flicker. The attached photo shows them side by side. The Belkin is clean because I had had it sealed for 5 years during a period when most of my stuff in storage.
